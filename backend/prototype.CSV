Although increasing blood perfusion due to high local temperature difference refers to the intelligent response of the human body, some researchers are accustomed to employing a constant rate of blood perfusion in the bioheat transfer equation. In this study, we considered a variable volumetric rate for blood perfusion in tissue, experimentally and numerically by Galerkin method. To validate the results obtained from numerical methods, an experimental procedure proposed. Furthermore, in order to transfer magnetic fluid by drug delivery, infusion pomp by which the saline serum with nanoparticles through the vein and artery was employed to make a spherical distribution in tissue. This circulation made it possible to transfer nanoparticles to tissue without any injection. After 60 minutes and changing the dark color of the saline serum to light clear, high amount of nanoparticles (about 90 %) was transferred to the tissue. After slicing the tissue, the rather spherical distribution of nanoparticles may be illustrated. Afterward, that circulation at the rate equal to blood perfusion has been made to simulate blood perfusion in dead tissue. To measure temperature, seven Lm35 sensors have been inserted into the tissue to report temperature differences. Based on results, there was seen a significant change in hyperthermic temperature difference in comparison with results obtained from Pennes' bioheat transfer equation. Additionally, a difference of about 5-10 % was seen between numerical and experimental results.

An algorithm was developed to calculate the fuel injection timing and injection duration based on engine speed, crank position, and intake air mass data. The intake air mass and engine speed under the vehicle driving conditions were simulated using a computer. In this study, phase I of the FTP-75 mode was used as the vehicle driving mode.
GT-Suite ® was used as the computer simulation software. The engine part load data, an automatic transmission shift map, torque converter data and various vehicle specifications were used as input data for the GT-Suite ® simulation. The computer simulation time interval is 0.05 seconds. An injector drive signal corresponding to the fuel injection amount and timing calculated by the developed algorithm was generated in a FPGA DAQ system. The drive signal from the FPGA DAQ is supplied to the base terminal of the transistor to switch the injector drive voltage source to control the fuel injection. The real-time measurement of the CIFM was done using load cells, dynamic strain amplifiers, and the FPGA DAQ system. The CIFM was measured at intervals of 0.05 seconds using an experimental apparatus developed when the vehicle was driven in the FTP-75 mode. A low-pass filter was used to remove the noise due to the impact force of the fuel jet on the load cell when measuring the CIFM. Twenty-eight repetitive measurements were conducted for an uncertainty analysis of the measurement data. A normal distribution was used as the error function. The deviation % distribution from the average CIFM value was evaluated at the 95 % confidence level. The deviation % from the average CIFM value was 3 % at 50 seconds after the start of phase I of the FTP-75 mode and converged to 0.2 % at 512 seconds."

Particles can be inserted and deleted in the solid region where interaction between the fluid and solid atoms is temporarily inactivated during the process. A simple momentum-increase scheme drives the inserted particles against the unfavorable free energy. The technique is efficient and stable for insertion of particles into dense and inhomogeneous regions.

But it is clear that the 2D lidar based method is much more efficient in terms of computational costs and sensor cost only. For successful leader-following of the mobile robot with the 2D lidar sensor on such hilly roads, it is necessary to develop a classifier capable of recognizing a specific body part of the leader differently from other parts. In this study, the Mahalanobis distance kernel based on two features extracted from the leader’s torso profiles is used to construct the elliptical decision boundaries for the classification problem. In addition, based on that classifier, the roll and pitch angle of the 2D lidar sensor are controlled to continuously track the leader's body part and to estimate the relative distance between the leader and the robot. As a result, even when the leader walks along paths with flat-to-hill transitions in day and night, the mobile robot successfully follows the leader with 80 % detection rate by stable pitching not exceed 1° of the 2D lidar sensor for keeping the torso inside its field of view. The proposed approach will be useful to improve the performances of multi-sensor based leader detection system using not only lidar sensor but also vision sensor with switching control scheme."

At the first stage, by tracking the reference zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory, the optimal center of mass (CoM) trajectory, which contributes to the minimal unit energetic cost (UEC) of one step, is solved analytically by using an unconstrained optimization method. At the second stage, to minimize the multi-joint mechanical work, the ZMP reference during the single support phase is optimized by a constrained optimization method. As a result, by considering the feasibility constraints such as the limitation on ZMP movement, the energy-efficient walking patterns can be generated in real-time. Furthermore, the energetic performances under different step parameter configurations, which consist of step length, step duration, and time ratio of double support, are discussed. Simulations and hardware experiments have demonstrated the energetic benefits of the proposed strategy when compared with other state-of-the-art works.

When a robot walks on soft soil, dynamic subsidence and slippage greatly reduce its walking performance. The influence of foot’s shape is usually ignored or simply studied without considering the multibody dynamics of the robot. This study is focused on the influence of the foot shape on the walking performance of a robot by coupling the sinkage with multibody dynamics. A composite contact model based on the Bekker, spring-damping, and Janosi? Hanamoto models was used to model the interaction of the robot and soft soil. Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surface and mesh were used to describe the geometries of foot and soft soil, respectively. The influences of three foot shapes on the sinkage and walking stability of the robot were analyzed by comparsion. The improved X-shaped foot reduced the robot’s sinkage and improved its walking stability."

To further expand its detection range and meet the needs of base construction in the future, it is necessary to design a legged mobile lander (LML) that lets the fixed lander walk. In this paper, a decoupled functions synthesis method (DFSM), which means the decoupled landing and walking functions for LMLs, is proposed: it uses separate structures of landing leg (LL) and walking leg (WL) to perform landing and walking functions. The structure of the Chang’e lander’s leg is selected and designed as the LL. The structures of WLs are determined and presented by the Lie group type synthesis method. In accordance with the combination principle, the landing-walking leg (LWL) for LMLs is designed by combining the structures of a LL and a WL. The structures of a family of LMLs are achieved by assembling the same or different structures of legs. Furthermore, the actuated joints are assigned according to the principle for selecting the actuated joint and one case of LWL is selected as an optimized type by the qualitative evaluation. Finally, one leg of LMLs is taken as an example to analyze the properties and abilities during different stages.

Alternative methods that do not reduce the fatigue strength, such as friction stir spot welding (FSSW), are being investigated. However, several studies have proven that FSSW joints are not sufficiently qualified for industrial usage. Defects such as keyholes, cavities, and cracks that form during classic FSSW with a screw stirring tool have not yet been eliminated. Some studies have demonstrated that the geometry of the stirring tool and the shoulder profile affect the quality of the joint. In this study, five pinless stirring tools with different shoulder profiles were designed to avoid the formation of cavities and cracks. The effect of the stirring tool on the mechanical properties and macro- and microstructural material properties during the joining process were examined.

Fiber misalignment, cracks, and voids are typical types of manufacturing defects in laminated composites. Defects can greatly reduce structural integrity and load carrying capacity, so their effects on material and structural strengths must be understood. In this paper, the effect of manufacturing defects on the progressive delamination behavior was studied for carbon/epoxy composite laminated L-beam under four-point bending test conditions. The defects of wavy plies and pure resin that had flowed out were characterized from surface photography and then transformed into finite element modeling using semi-automatic approach to which pre-delamination and void were included. Next, progressive failure analyses were performed with the interface delamination and matrix direction failure accounted for by cohesive zone modeling. Numerical results were examined focusing on the effects of defects on the peak load reduction and the variation of delamination pattern. The stacking sequence effect was also investigated.

This situation becomes more crucial for the structures with non-vanishing curvatures, such as arch- and shell-like bodies, owing to the additional membrane constraints. In addition, the choice of unsuitable shear correction factor (SCF), in dimensionally-reduced first-order analysis models, may become an additional source for the quality deterioration. In this context, we here propose a locking-free robust finite element approximation for the robust structural analysis of shell-like structures, by improving the degenerated 8-node shell element. In order to completely overcome the quality deterioration according to the thickness reduction, we combine the reduced integration (RI) and the modified shear correction factor.

Compared to traditional higher order shear deformation theories (HSDTs), the proposed method shows more efficient for FG-CNTRC plates analysis. To solve the C1-continuity requirement of the RPT, we used isogeometric analysis (IGA) to approximate the displacement field, which shows more advantages than the FEA, since it can construct higher-order elements without additional variables. This is an advantage for plate structural analysis because more variables make the calculation cumbersome. Finally, four types of FG-CNTRC plates were investigated and the results show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

In this study, two-dimensional shifting of the discahrge point was carried out to uncover the relationship between discharge point and flow, which tackes account of not onlu axial but also lateral distances while using a pin to two cylinder configuration. As a result, the characteristics of EHD flow can be modeled and expressed as a function of a distance parameter. Therefore, an empirical relation of momentum with the experimental variables was derived.

To study the formation mechanism and suppression of the reverse flow, a semi-open centrifugal pump with circumferential groove in the shroud was simulated. Then, the flow field and pressure fluctuation were analysed. The absolute flow angle at the blade inlet nearing the shroud was close to 180° because of the joint action of the leakage flow and blade inlet impact under low flow rate. This phenomenon resulted in the formation of a low-speed region and the reverse flow and low-frequency pressure fluctuation. The circumferential groove provided a channel for the leakage flow, which could quickly pass through the groove, and reduced the absolute flow angle at the blade inlet nearing the shroud and weakened the trend of the tip leakage flow to upstream. The low-frequency pressure pulsation was eliminated, and the amplitude of the blade passing frequency was reduced under 0.7 Q d (Q d is the design flow rate). The reverse flow thickness coefficient became zero with the circumferential groove. The proportion of the reverse flow volume to the volume of inlet pipe decreased from 14.7 % to 2.2 % under 0.4 Q d . This research indicated that the circumferential groove arranged in the shroud could effectively suppress or eliminate reverse flow.

Numerical calculations are performed to study the pressure fluctuation characteristics of centrifugal pump with wear ring clearance, especially in the regions of interaction between main flow and clearance flow (IMC) and clearance. The accuracy of numerical calculations is illustrated by comparing the experiments of performance and pressure fluctuation. Results show that, in clearance region the pressure fluctuation is still governed by blade passing frequency (f BPF ). Its amplitude of dominate frequency of pressure fluctuation becomes larger as the probe approaches the impeller exit. In IMC region, the pressure fluctuation at impeller outlet is dominated by f BPF . However, the dominate frequency at the entrance of impeller is less than f BPF . In addition, as the flow rate increased, the amplitude of dominate frequency of pressure fluctuation increases at impeller entrance, whereas an inverse trend is observed at wear ring clearance region."

In the multi-channel conduit, co-flows are driven by the constant pressure gradient in the three channels so that the mass-imbalance among the three channels may be observed in the above situations. Here, the mechanism leading to the mass flow imbalance caused by the orientation of magnetic field and by the spatial difference in the electric conductivity is discussed specifically. The results show that when the channels have spatially different electric conductivity the mass flow imbalance becomes more significant with an increasing of the angle of the applied magnetic field with respect to the plane parallel to the three channels (α).

Initially, an improved conjugate sensitivity factor method is proposed to find the most probable point. The method enhances its robustness of convergence by introducing a conjugate gradient direction based sensitivity factor technique and improves its computational efficiency by putting forward a hybrid conjugate gradient factor and an adaptive step length strategy. Subsequently, the dimension reduction-based saddlepoint approximation method is developed, which uses the dimension reduction approach to construct the limit state function as the additive univariate quadratic functions and applies saddlepoint approximation to obtain the result with higher precision. A comparison analysis from five mathematical and structural examples illustrates that the proposed method is better than most existing methods in terms of robustness, efficiency and accuracy for estimating the failure probability of structures.

Meanwhile, an antigen-based antibody selecting method, a density-based antibody screening method and an optimized judgment rule based on individual difference are presented for improving the iteration evolution. The presented methods and optimized judgment rule enhance the robustness and reduces training burden for the proposed approach, which leads to accurate anomaly detection in strong background noise and in practical industrial environment. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method has been proven experimentally by bearing fault diagnosing and centrifugal pump condition monitoring in this paper.

Some bodies with slope discontinuity can be modeled using absolute nodal coordinate formulation, which can accurately express the rigid body mode when using the element and global shape functions. However, at the intersection of slope discontinuities, it is not easy to construct the equation of motion because the orientation changes. The problem of modeling at the intersection can be solved by defining the global slope vector in the body coordinate system instead of the element coordinate system. The analysis time in absolute nodal coordinate formulation is mostly greater than that in floating frame of reference formulation owing to the highly non-linear stiffness matrix. In this study, based on the work of Shabana and Mikkola, the analysis efficiency was demonstrated using the nondimensional model for the slope discontinuity problem in the absolute node coordinate system.

The aim of this study is to investigate the new configuration of a semiactive single-stage nonlinear vibration isolation system with a Magneto-Rheological (MR) damper to reduce the magnitude of force transmissibility over the both resonant and nonresonant regions. The magnitude of force transmissibility is widely used to performance measurement for the isolation system. In current study, to achieve this reduction, two horizontal springs and one MR damper were added to the isolator. Theoretical analysis reveals that the nonlinear system with MR damper can produce ideal vibration isolation. However, due to the nonlinear characteristics behavior of the MR damper, conventional control algorithms to reach the desired are cumbersome. To address this issue, an artificial intelligent strategy using wavelet network and fuzzy logic controller is considered to be constructed to copy the inverse dynamics of the MR damper and the nonlinear isolator. Accordingly, simulation results demonstrated that the intelligent algorithm has acceptable performance.

The significance of the design parameters and the way in which the stable speed range is changed were determined by analyzing the sensitivity curves. Among the seven important parameters (out of 25), head angle was found to be the most dominant, followed by the diameter of front wheel, mass, and moment of inertia, demonstrating the importance of front side design to bicycle stability. The procedure for predicting the stable speed range using sensitivity information was also investigated. When a single parameter was changed, the stable range was determined by that parameter, whereas when multiple parameters were changed, the stable range was determined by summing all the contributions from each parameter. The weave speeds in the nominal and changed configurations yielding the lowest values were measured using an experimental bicycle of variable configuration. A comparison of the measured and predicted values of weave speeds showed a good correlation, demonstrating the validity of the sensitivity-based stability analysis. This study used a novel procedure for predicting the stable speed range through the sensitivity analysis of design parameters related to bicycle stability and validation of the stable speed range with experiment.

Furthermore, they are extremely nonlinear phenomena that are complex to analyze. Therefore, a classification-based real-time flood prediction model for urban areas is constructed in this study, by combining a numerical analysis model based on hydraulic theory with a machine learning model. Flood databases are constructed in advance for different rainfall scenarios using the Environmental Protection Agency?Storm Water Management Model (EPA-SWMM) and a two-dimensional inundation model. The flood depth data for each map grid are divided into five categories based on the average flood depth using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classification techniques for higher-precision flood range prediction. A model is constructed to predict the representative cumulative volume if the observed rainfall is entered. For spatial expansion of the flood depth with the predicted representative cumulative volume, a system capable of generating a real-time flood map is constructed by linking the cumulative volume of each grid with the representative cumulative volume using linear and nonlinear regression. When compared with the results of a verified two-dimensional (2D) flood model, the developed-model goodness-of-fit is 85%, with a required run time of 1 min 12 s. Using the developed system, rainfall-induced flooding can potentially be predicted, facilitating disaster risk management and minimizing damage to property and health.

A clear understanding of the uncertainty in multiple GCMs should be preceded before future meteorological droughts are projected. Therefore, this study evaluates the uncertainty in future meteorological drought characteristics that are induced by GCM ensemble using the custom measure “the degree of GCM spreading”. Future meteorological drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), were computed to five different time scales: 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months using statistically downscaled 28 GCMs under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 at 60 weather stations in South Korea. The frequency, duration, and severity of drought events were estimated for three different future periods; F1 (2010 ? 2039), F2 (2040 ? 2069), and F3 (2070 ? 2099). It was found that the uncertainty increases as the time scale lengthens regardless of a choice of drought indices or RCP scenarios. It also turned out that the SPI exhibits larger uncertainty rather than the SPEI, because temperature data exhibit a relatively much smaller variability comparing to precipitation data. Moreover, there was a shift of regions having larger values of the increasing rate between F1 and F2, which is shift from the north-western to southern region of South Korea."

In this study, the concrete specimens were prepared with different sand content ratio. Uniaxial compressive tests were performed for the specimens with AE monitoring to investigate the characteristics of AE parameters in the time domain (i.e., count, energy, and amplitude) and frequency domain (i.e., initial frequency and peak frequency). The experimental results were analyzed with the sand content ratio and failure step (1 ? 4) in order to determine the suitable AE parameter as a monitoring index. The most suitable parameter was shown as the cumulative energy parameter of AE with high sensitivity.

This paper introduces a method for predicting cutter life on the basis of statistics and regression. Traditional researches only evaluate the average mileage or time interval of each cutter change. Differently, the proposed method can accurately predict the mileage position of each cutter relatively, on the premise of knowing the installment radius of each cutter and the rock properties along the tunnel. In this procedure, the influence of the rock classification and rock properties of each cutter passing area on their passing distance is obtained by linear regression. For proposing and verifying the prediction method, totally 1,200 records of cutter changing caused by normal cutter wear are collected from the 4th Section of Water Supply Project from Songhua River. Among them, randomly selected 920 samples are used to determine the regression coefficients involved in the method. The method is verified by the rest 280 samples, and a reliable predicted result is obtained (MAPE = 27%, and R2 = 0.69).
An Analysis of Runway Accident Precursors Based on Latent Class Model;An Analysis of Runway Accident Precursors Based on Latent Class Model;오수환(한국과학기술원);김세윤(한국과학기술원),윤윤진(한국과학기술원);KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;대한토목학회;;202009;24(9);pp.2784~2793;Aviation safety, Runway safety, Rejected take-off, Latent class analysis, Negative binomial regression;Aviation safety, Runway safety, Rejected take-off, Latent class analysis, Negative binomial regression;토목공학;0;;10.1007/s12205-020-2395-x;In aviation safety, there has been an increasing emphasis on accident precursor analysis. The analysis of accident precursors can provide the advantage of identifying factors that may lead to an accident before it occurs. This study analyzes rejected take-off (RTO) incidents, which is one of the runway accident precursors, using 326 RTO incident cases from 2011 to 2017. The combined dataset is constructed for RTO incidents that occurred in South Korea, by integrating incident report data, airport operational data, and aircraft registration data. The risk factors to RTO incidents are examined, including surrogate measures of time pressure. The two-step modeling is adopted to identify contributory factors. First, latent class model is applied to group similar incidents, and then negative binomial regression per cluster is conducted. The cluster-wise analysis provides a richer set of results in terms of commonality and diversity in the limited number of incident cases. Airline category and aircraft type are identified as the common contributory factors. The cluster-specific factors are congested airport, surrogate measures of time pressure, and the first flight of the day. The findings of this study provide in-depth implications on safety management to make further improvements in aviation safety in South Korea.
Tidal Creek Extraction from Airborne LiDAR Data Using Ground Filtering Techniques;Tidal Creek Extraction from Airborne LiDAR Data Using Ground Filtering Techniques;김혜진(서울대학교);김용일(서울대학교),이재빈(목포대학교);KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;대한토목학회;;202009;24(9);pp.2767~2783;Tidal creek extraction, Airborne LiDAR data, Ground filtering, Cloth simulation filtering, Adaptive triangulated irregular network, gLiDAR, Tidal creek map;Tidal creek extraction, Airborne LiDAR data, Ground filtering, Cloth simulation filtering, Adaptive triangulated irregular network, gLiDAR, Tidal creek map;토목공학;0;;10.1007/s12205-020-2336-8;As elongated indentations or valleys in a wetland caused by tidal currents, tidal creeks act as drainage pathways and promote tidal flat evolution. Determining their geometric information is essential for topographical research of tidal flats. The airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system has been the most efficient surveying technique in tidal topography because it can directly acquire precise geo-referenced point clouds for wide areas. Existing tidal creek extraction methods using airborne LiDAR data have limitations such as excessive user intervention, lack of adaptability to various shapes and sizes of tidal creeks, and decreased precision due to conversion to the digital elevation model. This study aims to overcome these limitations and effectively extract various types of tidal creeks by utilizing ground filtering which is a technique to filter off-ground objects (such as buildings, trees, etc.) in land LiDAR surveys. To derive a suitable method for tidal creek extraction, three verified ground filtering techniques, adaptive triangulated irregular network, gLiDAR, and cloth simulation filtering (CSF), were selected and tested using LiDAR point data. We modified the application procedure and optimized their parameters to enable tidal creek extraction. Our results confirmed that CSF can extract various tidal creeks with minimal user intervention. Finally, we calculated their depths and generated a tidal creek map.

Among the different composite materials, fly ash blended cement has great part due to its abundance. In recent years, the pulverized fly ash has become the key interest among the researchers because of its improved physical properties. This makes it necessary to study the effect of fly ash blends with various chemical admixtures. This study primarily focuses on bringing the changes happening in the strength, retarding mechanism, setting time, mineralogy, and microstructure caused by the addition of Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4) in concrete having various percentages of raw fly ash (RFA) and ultrafine fly ash (UFFA). The result shows that ZnSO4 increases the setting time by more than 60%. Also, the study indicates decreased strength in concrete because of the reduced formation of hydrated products; this phenomenon is confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis."

Bentonite-cement-water glass grouting (BCG) is a grout with low environmental impact, designed to reduce the use of cement. The significance of this study is to explore the fundamental properties of BCGs with the bentonite contents of up to 50%, and the antiwash-out and permeability characteristics of BCG in comparison with cement-water glass grout (CG). The effects of water-to-solid ratios (W/S), bentonite content, water glass content and the volume ratio of bentonite-cement slurry to water glass slurry (Va: Vb) on the fundamental properties of BCGs were tested in the laboratory. The results show that the BCGs have excellent characteristics of high viscosity, low bleeding, short and controllable setting time, and high early strength. The BCGs have been applied to the pre-grouting of the water-rich sandy pebble stratum in the Wangfujing North Station section of Beijing Metro Line 8 and achieved better water sealing and reinforcement effects than CG.

A two-stage crack defect segmentation method based on target detection network is proposed to solve the problem of severe brightness imbalance and large noise in dam surface images. In the first stage, to improve the ability to locate crack areas, Inception Resnet V2 is used as feature extraction network to help Faster-RCNN extract more effective deep features, and the brightness, contrast of image is randomly adjusted before training. In the second segmentation stage, the crack areas are segmented at pixel-level using K-means. The experimental results on the self-made crack image dataset show that the location accuracy (AP) of the crack areas can be improved by 1.9%, reaching 96.8%, compared with other segmentation networks that do not locate crack areas, the intersection over union for segmentation of cracks (Iou) of the final segmentation results is at least 9.4% higher, reaching 52.7%. This method can provide effective technical support for inspection work of hydro-junction project.
System Identification of Structures with Severe Closely Spaced Modes Using Parametric Estimation Algorithms Based on Complex Mode Indicator Function with Singular Value Decomposition;System Identification of Structures with Severe Closely Spaced Modes Using Parametric Estimation Algorithms Based on Complex Mode Indicator Function with Singular Value Decomposition;Chang-Sheng Lin(National Pingtung University of Science and Technology);;KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;대한토목학회;;202009;24(9);pp.2716~2730;Modal interference, System identification, Complex mode indicator function, Singular value decomposition;Modal interference, System identification, Complex mode indicator function, Singular value decomposition;토목공학;0;;10.1007/s12205-020-1068-0;The modal-interference phenomenon usually makes difficulty of parametric estimation, especially for some structural systems with severe modal interference caused from close or even repeated modes. The existence of severe modal interference will degrade the effectiveness of system identification, and may lead to the problem of insufficient model order due to the existence of repeated modes. Multiple input/multiple output modal estimation is therefore usually conducted effectively to meet the sufficient number of measurement channels. In this paper, the Complex Mode Indicator Function (CMIF) is introduced to estimate the number of significant modes of a structure with severe modal interference, and then the singular value decomposition (SVD) is employed to parametric estimation of the major modes of a structural system without additionally evaluating enhanced frequency response function. Numerical simulations and experimental validation of a practical rectangular steel plate confirm the effectiveness of the presented method for parametric estimation of systems with severe closely spaced modes under noisy conditions.

Stress intensity factor performs a definitive role in reflecting material fracture and estimating fatigue life of tubular joints. Some researchers have proposed a series of parametric equations to predict SIF values; however, it gave arguably inaccurate results. There is still a need to improve the accuracy of the SIF prediction’s equation. Thus, to overcome this shortage, this study introduced back-propagation (BP) neural network with conjunction to genetic algorithm (GA) (GA-BP) in predicting the SIF of cracked tubular T/Y-joint. To train and verify the results of the hybrid algorithm GA-BP, SIFs' database covers a wide variety of cracked tubular T/Y joints were simulated by ABAQUS and verified against experimental results. Meanwhile, the SIFs' result produced by the GA-BP optimization method were compared with those SIF calculated from the accessible parametric equations. The comparison indicated that the GA-BP neural network optimization method is reliable, precise and capable tool in calculating the SIFs of cracked T/Y joints and it also provides higher accuracy than common methods."

In addition, the explicit Runge-Kutta time-stepping schemes do not come without any drawbacks even though the majority of discontinuous Galerkin applications have employed explicit ones due to simplicity. In this study, the recently developed implicit discontinuous Galerkin scheme is combined with the surface gradient method for steps (SGMS). The developed scheme is verified with flows over discontinuous bathymetry, i.e., vertical steps and weirs. For one-dimensional problems, the flows over a step and over a rectangular weir are simulated. As for two-dimensional problems, the flow over a weir and the dam-break flow over a step followed by the L-shaped and 45°-bend channels are simulated. The numerical solutions are compared with the experimental data. In all cases, good agreements were observed and the effectiveness of the developed scheme was verified.

The water flows induces the local scour of sediments under the caisson, which increases the settlement difficulty and threatens the safety of construction. A numerical model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was introduced to simulate the local scour process around the caisson. The numerical model was validated with a set of experimental tests, which were conducted to investigate the local scour for a square caisson model with different clearances under steady flow. The evolutions and characteristics of local scour pits as a function of clearance were investigated based on the experimental and numerical results. The effect of grain size of sediment and the scour mechanism for suspended caisson were discussed as well. The main findings include: 1) the minimum inflow velocity for the scour of sediment depends on the clearance between the caisson bottom and sediment; 2) the numerical model provides reasonable evolution of local scour pit and flow field around the caisson; and 3) the scour depth of suspended caisson can be as high as 70% of that for the settled caisson and deserves attention for the safe settlement of caisson."

To clarify this, a 3D fluid-solid coupling model was adopted to investigate thefailure mechanism from the perspective of hydrodynamics and temperature. The resultsshowed that during flood season the water pressure at the curve was much higher than that atthe straight area. High water pressure can cause higher water content at the curve. Meanwhile, thecurved levee is in essence a breach-sealing portion of levee. Hence, the frost-thaw damage ofrevetment and differential settlement of pavement are more likely to occur during winter.
Damage of revetment can aggravate the erosion at the curve while differential settlement caninduce the transverse fracture. These findings can provide a reference for reasonabledifferential settlement control as well as instruction of protective measures."

During the repository lifetime, the buffer material should guaranteethe safe disposal of HLW against any external mechanical impact, including seismic activity.
Therefore, the dynamic deformation properties of buffer material is crucial to validate itslifetime effectiveness and performance. Even though there are some researches to investigatethe dynamic properties of the bentonite buffer, there has been no researches for the Koreanbentonite buffer. For this reason, the paper aims to evaluate the dynamic properties at smallstrainof Gyeongju bentonite and correlate the small-strain deformation properties withunconfined compressive strength using seismic and static laboratory tests. Three sets ofcompacted cylindrical bentonite specimens with varying dry densities (1.50 g/cm3 to 1.77 g/cm3)were produced using a cold isostatic pressing technique under three different pressing loads.
Free-free resonant column (FFRC) tests and unconfined compressive (UC) tests wereperformed. The FFRC tests measured deformation properties at small strain, includingunconstrained and constrained compression velocities, Young’s modulus (Emax), constrainedmodulus (Mmax), material damping ratio (Dmin), and Poisson’s ratio. The UC tests evaluated thecompressive strength and secant modulus (E50) at large-strain. In this study, it was found thatthe deformation properties (Emax and Mmax) and unconfined compressive strength increase withthe increase in a design rage of dry density. Poisson’s ratio measured at constrained boundaryyields relatively constant value close to 0.4 for specimens at a range of dry density higher than1.5 g/cm3. In addition, it was found that the elastic moduli have an almost linear relationshipwith the unconfined compressive strength. Finally, empirical equations between elastic moduliand unconfined compressive strength for Gyeongju compacted bentonite are proposed for aKoeran design guideline."

The disposal of these wastes would require landfill space and can cause environmental pollution. In order to avoid disposal, the use of FA and BOF slag as sub-base material in highway pavement was investigated. The first part of this research was the characterization of FA and BOF in terms of their chemical and mineralogical compositions as well as the microstructural analysis. This is followed by the preparation of soil mixtures containing different proportions of kaolin, FA, BOF slag (0%, 15%, 20% and 25% by weight) and lime at a constant ratio (5%). Kaolin was used to represent the natural soil. The soil mixtures were cured for 1, 7 and 28 days and some were cured 56 days. At each curing age, the dry unit weight (?dmax), the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and California bearing ratio (CBR) were determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were also used to examine the changes in the phase-mineral composition and microstructure properties, respectively. The results show that the maximum dry unit weight values were observed in the mixture consisting of 25% FA, 15% BOF slag and 5% lime. The XRD analyses of kaolin soils containing, FA, BOF slag and lime exhibited the formation of hydrated products such as portlandite (C-H), calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) and calcium aluminium silicate hydrate (C-A-S-H), which increase with the age curing. According to results obtained, FA and BOF slag can be used in road base and sub-base materials.

The major objective of this research paper is to study the capability of BCCP to enhance the unconfined compressive strength of clayey soils. Two types of bacteria were used to generate calcium carbonate precipitation. The experimental design variables adopted in this study are bacteria types (L. fusiformis and S. pasteurii), soil types (low compressible clay and intermediate compressible clay), types of externally supplied calcium solution (calcium chloride and eggshell solution), molarities of cementing solution (0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 M) and curing period (1, 3 and 7 days). The experimental test results showed that the BCCP process significantly improves the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of both soils. The improvement however varied with bacterial types, soil types, types of externally supplied calcium solution, molarities of cementing solution and curing period. In BCCP treatment, S. pasteurii treated soils give more strength than L. fusiformis because of high urease activity of S. pasteurii in the order 450 U/ml. The maximum improvement ratio was achieved in CL soil (2.51) compared to CI soil (2.26) due to particle sizes. The optimum externally supplied calcium solution and molarity of cementing medium were established as an eggshell solution and 0.50 M, respectively. The images from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the experimental findings.

The laboratory tests associated with this study involved X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis, and direct shear testing. Test results indicate that shear stress decreases gradually in line with the number of freeze-thaw (F-T) cycling (NFT). When the NFT exceeds 7, F-T cycling no longer has any observably significant influence on the shear stress. The relaxation rate decreases during the first F-T cycle, after which almost no appreciable effect from F-T cycling is visible. It is concluded that, during the relaxation process, the shear stress decreases gradually and tends towards a stable value. A three stage process for the stress relaxation of soil samples affected by F-T cycling was observed: instantaneous relaxation; attenuated relaxation; and steady relaxation. Based on the experimental results, a disturbed state concept (DSC)-based stress-relaxation model for expansive soil exposed to freeze-thaw cycling was proposed. Close agreement between the experimental data and results predicted according to the model confirms the model’s validity."

(GDS) triaxial test system aftercontrolling initial matric suction. The results demonstrate that, the initial matrix suction andfreezing process can strengthen the shear strength of the soil, which makes the stress-straincurve of the soil show certain strain hardening characteristics at different temperatures. whenthe temperature is negative (including 0°C), the curve has a flat transition section whosestrength does not change with deformation, and the flat transition section becomes shorter asthe temperature and confining pressure decrease. The strength of the soil at negativetemperature and the speed at which it reaches its peak value are much greater than those ofthe soil after positive temperature and single freeze-thaw cycle, and the contribution ofconfining pressure to the strength decreases with the decrease of temperature. The effect oftemperature change (15oC to -15oC) on soil strength is mainly reflected in the total cohesion,and the effect of freeze-thaw on the effective internal friction angle is more significant. Thestrength and deformation characteristics of soil under the freezing process and freeze-thawcycle are determined by the initial matric suction, the form of connection between soilparticles, the migration of unfrozen water, and the degree of water-ice phase transformation.

To overcome this issue, this study treated the dredged fill from vacuum-electroosmosis with different additives. The parameters of discharged water, current, water content, and shear strength of soils treated with different amounts of Ca(OH)2, FeCl3, and NaCl were analyzed. The results showed that different additives have different effects on the vacuum-electroosmosis method for reinforcing dredger filling. Excessive additive contents were found to have an adverse effect on vacuum-electroosmosis, and hence, optimum amounts are required for the three additives. On comparing the optimum dosage of these additives, FeCl3 was observed to be the most energy-saving. From the aspect of anode corrosion and the costs involved, Ca(OH)2 was the most economical. For practical engineering applications, Ca(OH)2 was the most preferable additive. The results of this study provide guidance and scientific criteria for similar dredging foundation treatments."
Experimental Study of the Bulge Deformation of Anti-Seepage Geomembranes over Non-Fine Concrete;Experimental Study of the Bulge Deformation of Anti-Seepage Geomembranes over Non-Fine Concrete;Ke Gu(Hohai University);Yiming Shu(Nanchang Institute of Science and Technology),Xinxin Liu(Hohai University),Wenlong Mao(Nanchang Institute of Science and Technology),Zhen Zhang(Nanchang Institute of Science and Technology);KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;대한토목학회;;202009;24(9);pp.2591~2598;Geosynthetics, Geomembrane, Non-fine concrete cushion, 3D scanning, Thin-film pressure transducer, Bulge deformation;Geosynthetics, Geomembrane, Non-fine concrete cushion, 3D scanning, Thin-film pressure transducer, Bulge deformation;토목공학;0;;10.1007/s12205-020-1737-z;This study investigates the bulge deformation mechanics of geomembranes that are interacting with non-fine concrete cushions. We conducted 3D scanning of non-fine concrete specimens and further analyzed the depth-to-width ratios for non-fine concrete specimen surfaces. Then, stress distribution characteristics between the geomembrane and the non-fine concrete contact surface under diverse normal pressures were measured using a thin-film pressure transducer. It was observed that the contact surface between the geomembrane and the non-fine concrete expanded when the normal pressure increased, and the stress growth rate decreased as the area of the high-stress regions increased. Combining the relationship that was formed by the sags of the non-fine concrete surface soil with the stress distribution on the contact surface, the maximum bulge depth and the highest strain were determined following the formation of geomembrane bulge under various normal pressures. Moreover, ultrahigh strain, but not fracture, developed on the geomembrane during the experiment. Based on air bulking tests, it was demonstrated that the geomembrane had enormously high yield strength, which plays a critical role in the improvement of both the safety and the reliability of geomembranes that are mounted on non-fine concrete cushions.
Stability Analysis of Soil Slope Subjected to Perched Water Condition;Stability Analysis of Soil Slope Subjected to Perched Water Condition;Dong Tang(Changsha University of Science & Technology);Zhongming Jiang(Changsha University of Science & Technology),Tao Yuan(Hunan Pingjiang Pumped Storage Power Station Co., Ltd.),Yi Li(Key Laboratory of Water-Sediment Sciences and Water Disaster Prevention of Hunan Province);KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering;대한토목학회;;202009;24(9);pp.2581~2590;Slope stability, Limit equilibrium method, Perched water zone, Pore water pressure;Slope stability, Limit equilibrium method, Perched water zone, Pore water pressure;토목공학;0;;10.1007/s12205-020-1728-0;Perched water zone occurs in the subsurface of the slope under heavy rainfall or above an impeding layer with relatively low permeability. It causes a decrease in the shear strength of the soil and the increase in the loading on the slope. As the most used method of estimate the slope stability, the limit equilibrium method considers the influence of rainfall infiltration on the slope stability by increasing the underground water table and decreasing the shear strength parameters on the slip surface. However, the contribution of perched pore water pressure is usually ignored. To incorporate the effect of perched water pressure into the stability analysis, the Bishop’s simplified method and Janbu’s simplified method are modified to perform stability analysis in the situation of circular and composite slip surfaces, respectively. The detailed methodology and numerical implement procedure are presented. Then, three examples are adopted to verify the proposed methods and to investigate the impact of the perched water zone on slope stability. The results show that the program developed in this study has considerable accuracy compared to commercial software. The pore water pressure in the perched water zone has important impacts on slope stability, especially when the depth of the perched water zone is greater than 4 m. Ignoring the perched pore water pressure in the slope stability analysis might overestimate the safety status of the slope.

This paper presents simulations of tri-axial experiment tests and settlement of gravel layer. The stress-strain curves of gravel layer were analysed with different confining pressure through tri-axial numerical test, and the effect with different particle parameters and confining pressures was analysed. The numerical model of gravel layer after the excavation was established by the DEM to statistically analyse the settlement of gravel layer. The analyses results show that confining pressure corresponds to axial pressure that be destroyed of gravel particle model. The static friction coefficient has little effect on the failure of the tri-axial confining experimental model. The experiment model with various particle sizes need higher axial stress that be destroyed than the same particle size. During the collapse of the gravel stratum, the gravels are closer to the top of the hole which have a larger shift of settlement and a faster sedimentation rate. If the gravel are further away from top of the hole which have a smaller shift of settlement and slower sedimentation rate. The settlement of gravel causes the forces variation in all directions.

Major advantages of using blockchain technology includes reducing transaction costs, preventing data forgery and alteration, and further flexibility. The construction industry is generally considered as an industry that has great potentials for blockchain technology utilization mainly due to the high volume of transactions among various entities. Despite the perceived positive impact, there have been few cases of blockchain applications within the construction industry. This study is conducted with an aim of finding ways to apply blockchain technology to the construction industry. In order to identify potential application areas, construction lifecycle and project management knowledgeareas are used in developing a survey questionnaire. Data collected from the survey is analyzed by employing importance performance analysis (IPA) method considering both applicability of the technology and anticipated impact from utilizing the technology. In relation to the construction project lifecycle, ‘Project Cost/Change Management’, ‘Contract Bidding and Formation’, and ‘Procurement Evaluation’ are emerged as top three candidates for blockchain application with high applicability and impact. Regarding the knowledge area, ‘Procurement Management’ and ‘Cost Management’ are identified as the main blockchain application areas with high applicability and impact. All the identified specific construction tasks with high applicability and impact are related to ‘Procurement’, ‘Contract’, and ‘Cost’. Therefore, it is reasonable to start focusing blockchain convergence efforts these areas and then expand them as the technology matures.

The biological parameter (i.e., cell growth rate) is described as a form of the triangular fuzzy number. By using grade mean value conversion, the imprecise fuzzy parameter is translated into the degree of optimism (λ-integral value λ ∈ [0,1]) interval. We derive the sufficient conditions for the existence of the region of asymptotic stability (RAS) in the fuzzy cancer model. The boundary crisis of transient chaos and properties of RAS are investigated under fuzzy environment. We present a dynamical perturbation control to avoid uncontrolled tumor cell growth and prevent healthy cell extinction.

The considered systems are involved in the existence of whole state delays and stochastic disturbances, which makes the controller design more difficult and complex. Firstly, time delays are related to unknown dynamic interactions with the whole states of the agent systems, and novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are constructed. Secondly, the smooth asymmetric saturation nonlinearity is given based on Gaussian error function, output constraints are achieved via barrier Lyapunov functions, and neural networks are utilized to deal with the completely unknown nonlinearities and stochastic disturbances. Then, based on Lyapunov stability theory, a delay-independent adaptive controller is developed via Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and backstepping technique, and it reduces the complexity of learning parameters. It is proved that the proposed approximation-based controller can guarantee that all closed-loop signals are cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (CSGUUB), and the tracking errors between the followers and the leaders eventually converge to a small neighbourhood around the origin. Finally, simulation studies are carried out, and the simulation results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed Strategy.

In the TN-LCD using the rubbing method, a pretilt angle of 0.05° was obtained, and it was confi rmed that an excellent pretilt angle of 1.13° also occurred in the TN-LCD irradiated with an ion beam. In addition, voltage-transmittance characteristic, which is a characteristic for realizing gray scale, was measured using the TN-LCD manufactured as described above. And, the response time characteristic was measured as a basic feature to compose a screen without motion blur. As a result, both the TN-LCD using the rubbing method and the TN-LCD manufactured by ion beam irradiation showed good voltage-transmittance characteristics in the driving voltage range of 1.5?3.5 V. In particular, as a result of measuring the response time characteristics, the light-on time was measured at 5.11 ms and the light-off time was measured at 10.98 ms. This is a very good result at the level of TN-LCD without chiral dopant, which can be evaluated as comparable with the result of the production level.

The existing insulation monitoring system in uninterruptible state was only possible with attachment type devices, but there was no portable inspection equipment at the site. This algorithm is called asymmetric high resistance detection (AHRD), which can compensate for the shortcomings of existing pulse and passive measurement methods, like not being able to measure when both positive and negative electrodes are poorly insulated. The researchers then developed a device that uses this algorithm for the on-site testing of direct current power supply systems, such as solar power generation units and energy storage systems (ESSs). Conversion and estimation formulas were also developed and verifi ed by analyzing the correlation between the measurement values and simulation results of the device’s sensor parameter settings. A standard power supply and standard resistance were used on the newly developed insulation meter to assess it using a lab test and a performance test. Its performance is verifi ed through a comparative analysis between the newly developed insulation meter with the existing insulation monitoring device at an ESS site. Applying the technology proposed in this study at testing sites can enable the verifi cation of the insulation state of circuitry and direct current power supply systems, thereby preventing accidents by ensuring electrical safety.

Firstly, an inverse evolutionary neural model (IEN) that is utilized for offline identifying a dynamics of quadruple tank system, provides a feed-forward control signal from the reference liquid level. In which, the evolutionary neural model is a 3-layers neural network that is optimized by a hybrid method of modified differential evolution and backpropagation algorithm.

Finally, to solve an uncertainty and disturbance characteristic, an adaptive law is proposed to adopt online in its operation. Simulation and real-time control experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for the quadruple-tank system.

Lateral displacement control is essential for the path tracking effect. The objective of this research is to develop a lateral displacement control system to control the lateral position of tractor. Based on the kinematic model, a cascade control scheme for lateral displacement control system was designed. The two feedback loops in the cascade control structure were implemented using the measurements of the Beidoureceiver and gyroscope respectively.

A set point filter was added in the outer loop to improve the tracking performance. The simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed control scheme by showing fast response, control accuracy and robust performance for the lateral displacement control system.

The current catenary evaluation model only considers quantitative detection indicators, without qualitative indicators such as weather, which is one-sided to some extent. Thus, an improved catenary status evaluation model is constructed with both quantitative indicators and qualitative indicators. In this evaluation model, the normal fuzzy matter-element method is used to determine the correlation value of each grade, and the weighted average principle is used to re-determine the status grade of catenary when the maximum correlation principle fails. Meanwhile, entropy weight method and particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize analytic hierarchy process method are combined to improve the shortcomings of single weight method, and game theory is used to determine the subjective and objective weight coeffi cients, so as to reduce the infl uence of subjective experience. Select a Chinese railway catenary in 2018 as an example for verifi cation analysis, the results show that the model constructed in this paper can eff ectively help professionals to make correct judgments on the health status of catenary, and provide a new idea and method for the comprehensive evaluation of the catenary operation status, which has certain practicability

Mechanical model of the pitching axis, mechatronics model of the speed control system for the pitching axis, and speed algorithm model of a permanent magnet synchronous motor are established. Control rates of the extended state observer (ESO) and the nonlinear state error feedback (NSEF) of the traditional ADRC are improved using a new nonlinear function. The nonlinear dynamics, model uncertainty, and external disturbances of the speed control system are extended to a new state, and the improved ESO is implemented to observe this state. The overtime variation of the speed control system is predicted and compensated for in real time using the improved ESO.

There are various algorithms for optimization problems nowadays. Metaheuristic algorithms are the algorithms giving almost optimum solutions at an acceptable duration for the problems of large dimension. Heuristic optimization algorithms with general aim are evaluated in diff erent groups. Swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms were developed through examining the behaviors and movements of living fl ocks such as birds, fi sh, cats, and bees. With these algorithms, some estimating processes are carried out successfully in all areas. In this study a new approach was presented with a novel idea, by inspiring from the behavior type of Glowworm Swarm Optimization; and an application estimating the total population, square measurement and electricity quantity that was consumed by the chosen areas in a region was developed. The developed application works as a real-time and animated display. When all calculations are fi nished, the animation ends. Estimates also examined England as an example. The diff erence between the estimated value of the actual population of England is calculated as 1.7%. In the estimates for the values of the surface area of England with an error of 1.4%, the estimated values were very close to the actual values.

Continuous Integral Sliding Mode Control of an Offshore Container Crane with Input Saturation;;김경한(부산대학교);;International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems;International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems;제어·로봇·시스템학회;Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems;202009;18(9);pp.2326~2336;Crane control, integral sliding mode control, offshore container crane, super twisting sliding mode control.;;제어계측공학;0;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12555-019-9852-7;10.1007/s12555-019-9852-7;An offshore container crane is expected to realize high productivity and economic feasibility in the maritime logistics due to its versatile functions for container transportation. However, severe working conditions resulting from the oceanic environment may cause difficulty in its accurate and safe cargo transfer. Specifically, the presence of ship-motion-induced disturbances, wind disturbances and parameter uncertainties in the payload mass and rope length result in positioning errors and large swings during ship-to-ship transportation. For efficient cargo transportation, such control problems should be solved with consideration of physical constraints like control input saturation. Therefore, a continuous integral sliding mode control is developed in this study using a 4-degreesof-freedom (4-DOFs) dynamic model with input saturation. The control scheme consists of two parts: i) A supertwisting control for disturbance rejection, and ii) a nominal control to drive the state vector to the desired equilibrium point. Therein, the nonlinear integral-type sliding surface is decoupled into two sub-systems, so that the control laws for the lateral and longitudinal trolley dynamics are independently developed. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system in consideration of the input saturation is assured by the Lyapunov method. Moreover, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy compared with the conventional sliding mode control.

In this paper, a robot tracking algorithm in SLAM with Masreliez-Martin unscented Kalman filter (MMUKF) is proposed. A robot dynamic model based on SLAM characteristics is first used as state equation to model the robotic movement, and the measurement equations are deduced by linearizing the motion model. Next, the covariance of process noise is estimated with an adaptive factor to improve tracking performance in the MMUKF. Finally, the MMUKF is employed to estimate the positions of robot and landmarks. The proposed algorithm can complete robot tracking with good accuracy, and obtain reliable state estimation in SLAM.

Each joint module, which is the basic unit for constructing the reconfi gurable manipulators, is regarded as a subsystem with model uncertainties that include the error of frictional modeling and the interconnection dynamic coupling (IDC) eff ect. Then, by employing a robust controller and a neural network (NN) identifi er-based compensation controller, the decentralized guaranteed cost control issue with uncertain environments can be changed into the optimal control issue of reconfi gurable manipulators. Based on ADP algorithm, the critic neural network is introduced to approximate the modifi ed cost function, and then the Hamilton?Jacobi?Bellman equation is addressed by the policy iterative algorithm, thus making the obtention of approximate optimal control policy doable. The stability of the robotic system under the proposed control policy is demonstrated by employing the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the eff ectiveness of the proposed control policy for reconfi gurable manipulators with diff erent confi gurations is verifi ed by simulation experiments.

Thus, a robot must determine which motion to perform based on a given situation. This study presents an approach to learning a decision-making ability for the robot to grasp the target object after rearranging the surrounding objects obstructing the target object. The learning is performed in the virtual environment, and the image, which is an input of the deep Q-network, is preprocessed todirectly apply the results of the learning to the real environment. That is, the difference between the two environments is minimized by making the states obtained from the virtual and real environments similar to each other. In addition, image preprocessing can be used to generalize the results of learning so that the robot can determine the appropriate actions to take when objects that were not used for learning are given. A hierarchical structure, which consists of high-level and low-level motion selectors, is used for the learning: the former determines the grasping or pushing actions while the latter determines how to perform such selected actions. The results of various experiments show that the proposed scheme is effective in grasping the target object in a cluttered environment without the need for any additional learning in the real world.

The major contributions of this work are twofold. First, the well-known and widely used min?max and trilateration methods are tested in the cases of without and with human movement eff ects. By this purpose, how RSSI data during human movements aff ect the accuracy of such methods and which method shows the best position estimation result, have been investigated. Second, we also design and develop a new RSSI fi lter to automatically reduce RSSI variation and the position estimation error caused by human movements. Experiments are carried out in a parking building.
An LPC2103F microcontroller interfaced with a CC2500 RF transceiver as a low-cost, low power, 2.4 GHz radio module is used as a wireless node. Results demonstrate that without human movement eff ects, the performances by both localization methods are not much diff erent. However, with human movement eff ects, the min?max method shows better accuracy than the trilateration method in handling the RSSI variation problem. The results also indicate that by applying the proposed RSSI fi lter, it can directly cope with the RSSI variation problem caused by humans. The localization error decreases by 69.87% for the case of the min?max method, and it decreases by 72.74% for the case of the trilateration method (the best case). Compared with the case of employing the moving average fi lter as the commonly used fi lter, the localization error only decreases by 18.67% and 12.99%, respectively."

Based on this, we analyze the organization of algorithms, the processing of the sEMG data, and how the number of channels aff ects learning. The optimal deep natural network model selected by the analysis is implanted to embedded after learning. The implanted model performs a portable real-time torque optimization (PRTE) according to the sEMG signal entered.

Conventional criteria on stability for switched stochastic systems are based on the negativity of the infinitesimal generator of Lyapunov functions, it is demonstrated that these criteria are conservative. Taking this fact into account, the infinitesimal generator for each active subsystem acting on Lyapunov functions is relaxed to be indefinite with the help of uniformly stable function (USF). Subsequently, improved criteria on asymptotic stability are proposed by applying the weakened condition and modedependent average dwell time (MDADT) technique. In addition, numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.

As the aspect ratio increases, a tendency toward uniform plasma conditions of electron density on 450 mm wafer is refl ected by an increase in the input power ratio of the outer coil. In the case of an aspect ratio of 0.29 (radius: 350 mm, height: 200 mm), the power distribution has a ratio of about 1.4:8.6, and the non-uniformity of the 450 mm wafer region is less than 1%. A lower aspect ratio is advantageous in terms of plasma uniformity. The plasma uniformity can be negatively aff ected by the electron density distribution changing to M-shape in the case of a lower aspect ratio of 0.3. When designing the chamber, the ratio of the surface area to the volume must be considered due to the diff erences in the plasma characteristics according to the radii and heights.

The proposed antenna consists of an internal direct feed dipole and an external coupled feed dipole. This coupled feed mechanism, which is often used in microstrip patch antennas, is applied to the dipole element for a wide matching bandwidth. To verify the operating principle of the proposed antenna, an equivalent circuit model is investigated along with some parametric studies of the coupling eff ect. The proposed antenna is then extended to an eight-element uniform circular array to confi rm the beamforming performance for PCL systems. The results demonstrate that the coupled feed dipole element is more suitable to enhance the matching bandwidth compared to a conventional dipole antenna

Finally, the applicability of the developed control design technique and its less conservativeness over other existing ones are proven by means of simulation Examples.

Unlike continuous event-triggered mechanism (ETM) requiring dedicated hardware and complex Zeno-avoidance computation, an output-based discrete ETM is firstly introduced, which overcomes limits of continuous ETM and relaxes state-available constraint. Secondly, a novel time-delay system model is established, which makes it possible to study effects of the ETM, stochastic attacks and network-induced delays in a unified framework. Thirdly, less-conservative asymptotic stability criteria with desired H∞ index are obtained, which derive quantitative relationships among the ETM, stochastic attacks, network delays, plant and resilient controller. Further, sufficient conditions to co-deign the ETM and resilient controller are presented. Finally, examples confirm effectiveness of the proposed method.

First, in order to estimate the system states, actuator and sensor faults, only one observer with an adaptive nonlinear gain is required where the minimum phase condition is relaxed to delectability and the matching condition is weakened to become a condition related to the system dimensions. Furthermore, our approach is applicable where there are faults greater than outputs. Next, a virtual sensor technique is developed to replace a failed, missing or corrupted sensor to provide a signal having the same effect of the nominal sensor. Then, this study provides an adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant control to achieve an optimal interaction between observer, virtual sensor and controller models. Thus, using the LMI technique with multiobjective optimization performance, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the closed-loop Lipschitz nonlinear system stability and guarantee that the Lipschitz set of the adaptive sliding mode observer is a subset of the adaptive sliding mode control Lipschitz set. Two illustrative examples the first is the robotic manipulator model and the second is the longitudinal dynamics of the following vehicle system were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed Approach.

A novel type of sensor head with electric winding light is proposed. A complete optical model of the optical fi bre current sensor is developed under the eff ect of polarization error factors. In addition, the eff ect of polarization error factors on the optical fi bre sensing system is simulated. The simulation results show that as the extinction ratio increases, the output relative error of the optical fi bre small-current sensor decreases. The eff ect of the fast and slow axis misalignment errors of a polarizing beam splitter is similar to the eff ect of the alignment angle error of an optical fi bre polarizer. It is observed that the relative error curve follows a sine function. Meanwhile, the output relative error increases fi rst and then oscillates with an increase in the linear birefringence. We conclude that the linear birefringence of the sensing optical fi bre is the main error source for the measurement accuracy of the sensing system. Finally, an experimental system for the optical fi bre small-current sensor is implemented. The experimental results show that the eff ect of linear birefringence on the fi bre current sensing system can be suppressed by introducing a large amount of circular birefringence into the sensing optical fi bre. The theoretical mechanism of these errors is analysed, which can be applied to implement corresponding measures to reduce the eff ect of error factors on the sensing system and further improve the measurement accuracy of the optical fi bre small-current sensor.

In order to save resources, an event-triggered pinning scheme subjected to input saturation is designed. Suppose that the signed graph representing cooperative-competitive interactions is structurally balanced, and the initial states for the agents belong to the specified ellipsoid. By using Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the bipartite tracking consensus of the system under event-triggered pinning control can be achieved. Moreover, the bipartite tracking consensus of system with Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics is also investigated, and Zeno behavior can be excluded. Subsequently, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Thus, high-power transmitter requires an impedance matching circuit to improve the low-power factor of a transducer. Conventional matching circuits composed of L and C elements have many additional lumped elements. In addition, transducers for active sonar have numerous channels. As a result, the implementation of the matching circuit with many devices is non-practical and bulky due to spatial limitations.

In addition, a design method of a transformer that implements a matching circuit using magnetization inductance is proposed. The proposed matching circuit is verifi ed by the experimental results, and the volume and weight are reduced by approximately 20% compared to the conventional matching circuit

The virtual power rating is fl exibly determined according to the SoC to obtain the droop gain of BU, and the balanced SoC is achieved by means of the modifi ed droop controller. Because an accurate power sharing among BUs is satisfi ed by using only virtual power rating, SoC balancing performance is consistently ensured regardless of the line resistance diff erence.

The criterion from the conventional mixed potential theory contains multiple time-varying parameters which are complicated for convenient stability analysis hence the need for simplifi cation. On the other hand, stability analysis of droop-controlled multiple source converter-based DC systems are scarce. Thus, the large-signal stability criterion of a scaled-down droop-controlled multi-terminal MVDC distribution network with CPL using Brayton-Moser’s mixed potential theory was simplifi ed and derived to show that CPL power rating, PI control parameters, droop and damping coeffi cients have profound eff ects on the system’s large-signal stability. By way of MATLAB/Simulink simulations, the large-signal stability of the MVDC distribution system was observed to reduce with increase in CPL power rating and source converter droop coeffi cients as well as increase with increase in proportionate coeffi cient values and use of optimized unlike non-optimized damping coeffi cients. Therefore, the droop-controlled MVDC distribution network with optimized PI control parameters, droop and damping coeffi cients have enhanced dynamic response and large-signal stability margin proving the accuracy and validity of the simplifi ed large-signal stability criterion.

In order to mitigate these oscillations, power system stabilizers (PSS) are used through excitation control. Three recently developed meta-heuristic algorithms namely: Collective Decision Optimization (CDO), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) have been applied for the optimal tuning of PSS parameters for small signal stability analysis of a renewable integrated power network. This was done by designing a conventional speed-based lead-lag PSS in a multi-machine interconnected power system, whose parameters have been tuned using CDO, GOA and SSA in a way to shift all the eigenvalues associated to electromechanical modes to the left half of S plane. Comparison of the results obtained by the algorithms demonstrates the superiority of SSA over GOA and CDO to boost the overall system stability over a wide range of operating conditions. The PSS controller designed using SSA is observed to be more robust and effi cient in damping out oscillations under diff erent operating conditions.

However, space charge can cause dielectric breakdowns by aff ecting the electrical characteristics inside the insulator as it is injected, generated, or moved inside the insulating materials. In this study, the sheet-like space charge distribution of the insulator cross-linking polyethylene (XLPE) was measured using the pulsed electro acoustic (PEA) method. As compared to the existing method, a more convenient method was designed and produced using NI’s PXI System and LabVIEW software. Furthermore, a signal calibration program was developed to correct the distortions of the measured signals. The accuracy and reliability of the space charge distribution signals were improved by correcting the distortions of the signals.

Further, Reconciled Pack Dominance based Grey Wolf Optimisation (RPD-GWO) is proposed to solve SSRCOPF problem. Due to the colossal increase in demand, transmission lines are stressed by overloading. To alleviate this stress, often series compensation by Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) is used. However, due to unintended operation of TCSC there is a possibility of Sub-synchronous Resonance (SSR).
Hence, SSR constraint is infused into Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and termed as SSRCOPF. The proposed SSRCOPF ensures optimal system operation, while circumventing the entrapment into SSR condition. To solve the SSRCOPF problem the proposed RPD-GWO algorithm is employed and analysed with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO).

However, at off - nominal frequency, it generates errors in both magnitude and phase angle due to spectral leakage. Moreover, its harmonic rejection ability is greatly impaired in this case. This paper introduces a method to apply sliding Fourier transform under off -nominal frequency at fi xed sampling rate while fi xing the defects associated with it off -nominal frequency operation. This method involves the use of two stages sliding Fourier transform (SFT). A fi xed window-width SFT in the fi rst stage is used to drive the variable window-width SFT in the second stage. The proposed technique (SFT?SFT) is tested in real time on dSPACE MicroLabBox using pre-generated voltage vectors to simulate the most inconvenient grid conditions. The testing scenarios proved its superior performance compared to the decoupled stationary reference frame PLL method.

Therefore, oscillation monitoring systems in real-time are of critical importance to detect the danger of poorly damped oscillations. For the detection and analysis of the oscillations, high-temporal-resolution measurements are required according to the Nyquist theorem. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for the identifi cation of electromechanical oscillations using low-sampled data such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements.
Methods The lack of temporal resolution of the data is compensated by using low-sampled data sets at multiple diff erent locations. At a target location, a high-sampled data-signal can be reconstructed using mode shape information obtained from model-based modal analysis. The variable projection method is then used to detect oscillations and estimate oscillation components including frequency and damping ratio.
Results Case studies based on practical Korean power systems are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can detect and identify electromechanical oscillations with lowsampled data."

Power system stabilizers (PSSs) are the most advised and effi cient devices to increase the system damping and enhance the dynamic characteristics of power networks during abnormal conditions. Unfortunately, the performance of the PSS controller is mostly dependent on the parameters of the lead-lag compensator. Within this context, this study presents a new chaoticbased sunfl ower optimization algorithm with local search (CSFO-LS) for optimum design of PSS controllers.
Methodology In the proposed algorithm symbolized by CSFO-LS, the random parameters of the original SFO are substituted by chaotic sequences to avoid premature convergence at local optima and improve the accuracy of the optimum solution. Firstly, the CSFO-LS is tested and evaluated on various benchmark functions with diff erent characteristics such as multimodality, separability and regularity. Then, it is applied for selecting the optimum parameters of the PSS controllers.
These parameters are tuned in order to shift all electromechanical modes in a pre-specifi ed zone in the left side of the s -plan.
Results Simulation results based on eight benchmark functions show that CSFO-LS outperforms all the algorithms used for comparison. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed method for providing good damping of low frequency oscillations, a standard power system test under various operating conditions and severe fault is used. Obtained results are compared with those obtained using the original SFO and other recent optimization techniques.
Originality In this study, an improved version of the SFO is proposed for providing optimum EMOs damping. All EMOs have to be shifted as much as possible to the left side of the s -plan instead of shifting them to a fi xed zone. To our best knowledge, this technique is not suggested or used for any power system problem."

Uncertainties related to DGs, loads and contingencies and the capability of energy storage devices for peak shaving and renewable energy compensation are also inherent. The allocation model simulates the network transfer process to postpone the DG investment. The trade-off between the defi ned annual total cost and N-1 security margin index is achieved in the optimal allocation methodology considering operation thresholds and security improvements.

Specifi cally, the reliability evaluation of the load data is to properly eliminate noise/outliers caused by random power consumption behaviors or the sudden change in load demand from industrial and residential customers in the DN. Thus, this paper proposes a novel statistical data-fi ltering method, working at an input data pre-processing stage, which will evaluate the reliability of input load data by analyzing all possible data confi dence levels in order to fi lter-out the noise/outliers for accuracy improvement of diff erent short-term load forecasting models. The proposed statistical data-fi ltering method is also compared to other existing data-fi ltering methods (such as Kalman Filter, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)). Moreover, several case studies of short-term load forecasting for a typical 22 kV distribution network in Vietnam are conducted with an Artifi cial Neural Network (ANN) model, a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) model, a combined model of Long Short-Term Memory Network and Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-CNN), and a conventional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to validate the statistical data-fi ltering method proposed. The achieved results demonstrate which the STLF using ANN, LSTM-RNN, LSTMCNN, and ARIMA models with the statistical data-fi ltering method can all outperform those with the existing data-fi ltering methods. Additionally, the numerical results also indicate that in case the SCADA-based load data is normally distributed, time-series forecasting models should be more preferred than neural network models; otherwise, when the SCADA-based load data contains multiple normally distributed sub-datasets, neural network-based prediction models are highly recommended."

A high-temperature, thermally conductive microporous coating (HTCMC) was created by sintering copper powder with an average particle size of 67 mm onto a 1cm 1 cm plain copper surface with a coating thickness of ~300 mm within a furnace in a vacuum environment. The tests showed that the nucleate boiling heat transfer coef?cient (NBHT) of HTCMC became slightly less enhanced as the concentration of boric acid increased but the NBHT coef?cient values were still signi?cantly higher than those of the plain surface. The critical heat ?ux (CHF) values from 0 to 1.0 vol% were maintained at ~2,000 kW/m2, and then, they gradually decreased down to ~1,700 kW/m2 as the concentration increased further to 5.0 vol%. It is believed that the micro-scale pores of the HTCMC were partially blocked by the high boric acid concentration during the nucleate boiling such that the small bubbles were not effectively created using the HTCMC reentrant cavities as the boric acid concentration increased

The concept of the hybrid SIT is to connect the pressurizer to SIT to utilize the water inside SIT in the case of SBO or SB-LOCA combined with TLOFW. We investigated how well RELAP5 code predicts the physical phenomena in terms of the equilibrium time, strati?cation, condensation against Separate Effect Test (SET) data. We also conducted the validation of RELAP5 code against Integrated Effect Test (IET) experimental data produced by the ATLAS facility. We followed conventional approach for code validation of IET data, which are pre-test and post-test calculation. RELAP5 code shows substantial difference with changing number of nodes. The increase of the number of nodes tends to reduce the condensation rate at the interface between liquid and vapor inside the hybrid SIT. The environmental heat loss also contributes to the large discrepancy between the simulation results of RELAP5 and the experimental data
Criticality benchmarking of ENDF/B-Ⅷ.0 and JEFF-3.3 neutron data libraries with RMC code;;Zheng Lei(Tsinghua University, Beijing);Huang Shanfang(Tsinghua University, Beijing),Wang Kan(Tsinghua University, Beijing);Nuclear Engineering and Technology;Nuclear Engineering and Technology;한국원자력학회;Korean Nuclear Society;202009;52(9);pp.1917~1925;RMC, ENDF/B-Ⅷ.0, JEFF-3.3, Benchmark;;원자력공학;0;;10.1016/j.net.2020.02.022;New versions of ENDF/B and JEFF data libraries have been released during the past two years with significant updates in the neutron reaction sublibrary and the thermal neutron scattering sublibrary. In order to get a more comprehensive impression of the criticality quality of these two latest neutron data libraries, and to provide reference for the selection of the evaluated nuclear data libraries for the science and engineering applications of the Reactor Monte Carlo code RMC, the criticality benchmarking of the two latest neutron data libraries has been performed. RMC was employed as the computational tools, whose processing capability for the continuous representation ENDF/B-Ⅷ.0 thermal neutron scattering laws was developed. The RMC criticality validation suite consisting of 116 benchmarks was established for the benchmarking work. The latest ACE format data libraries of the neutron reaction and the thermal neutron scattering laws for ENDF/B-Ⅷ.0, ENDF/B-Ⅶ.1, and JEFF-3.3 were downloaded from the corre?sponding official sites. The ENDF/B-Ⅶ.0 data library was also employed to provide code-to-code vali?dation for RMC. All the calculations for the four different data libraries were performed by using a parallel version of RMC, and all the calculated standard deviations are lower than 30pcm. Comprehensive analyses including the C/E values with uncertainties, the dk=s values, and the metrics of c2 and < jDj >, were conducted and presented. The calculated keff eigenvalues based on the four data libraries generally agree well with the benchmark evaluations for most cases. Among the 116 criticality benchmarks, the numbers of the calculated keff eigenvalues which agree with the benchmark evaluations within 3s in?terval (with a confidence level of 99.6%) are 107, 109, 112, and 113 for ENDF/B-Ⅶ.0, ENDF/B-Ⅶ.1, ENDF/B- Ⅷ.0 and JEFF-3.3, respectively. The present results indicate that the ENDF/B-Ⅷ.0 neutron data library has a better performance on average.

By comparison of MCS calculation results to post irradiation examination (PIE) data obtained from one pressurized water reactor (PWR), the validation of this capability is conducted. The depletion analysis is performed with the ENDF/B-VII.1 library and a fuel assembly model. The transmutation equation is solved by the Chebyshev Rational Approximation Method (CRAM) with a depletion chain of 3820 isotopes. 18 actinides and 19 ?ssion products are analyzed in 14 SNF samples. The effect of statistical uncertainties on the calculated number densities is discussed. On average, most of the actinides and ?ssion products analyzed are predicted within ±6% of the experiment. MCS depletion results are also compared to other depletion codes based on publicly reported information in literature. The code-to-code analysis shows comparable accuracy. Overall, it is demonstrated that the depletion capability in MCS can be reliably applied in the prediction of SNF isotopic inventory

The solutions of DeCART stand-alone calculations for the control rod bank worth, detector signal, isothermal temperature coefficient, and critical boron concentration agreed very well with the measurements. The root-mean-square errors of the boron letdown curves for two-cycles were less than about 20 ppm, while the individual and total control rod bank worth agreed well within 7.3% and 2.4%, respectively. For the BEAVRS benchmark calculations at the beginning of burnup, the difference between DeCART simplified thermal-hydraulic stand-alone and DeCART/MATRA coupled calculations were not significantly large. Therefore, it is concluded that both the DeCART stand-alone code and the DeCART/MATRA multi-physics coupled code system have the capabilities to generate high fidelity transport solutions at core follow calculations.
Overcoming the challenges of Monte Carlo depletion: Application to a material-testing reactor with the MCS code;;dos vutheam(울산과학기술원 기계 및 원자력공학 연구부 (미사용));이현석(울산과학기술원),조윤기(울산과학기술원),마튜 르메르(울산과학기술원),김원경(울산과학기술원),최수영(울산과학기술원),Zhang Peng(울산과학기술원),이덕중(울산과학기술원);Nuclear Engineering and Technology;Nuclear Engineering and Technology;한국원자력학회;Korean Nuclear Society;202009;52(9);pp.1881~1895;MCS, Monte Carlo depletion, MCNP6, Material-testing reactor;;원자력공학;0;;10.1016/j.net.2020.02.003;The theoretical aspects behind the reactor depletion capability of the Monte Carlo code MCS developed at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) and practical results of this depletion feature for a Material-Testing Reactor (MTR) with plate-type fuel are described in this paper. A verifi- cation of MCS results is first performed against MCNP6 to confirm the suitability of MCS for the criticality and depletion analysis of the MTR. Then, the dependence of the effective neutron multiplication factor to the number of axial and radial depletion cells adopted in the fuel plates is performed with MCS in order to determine the minimum spatial segmentation of the fuel plates. Monte Carlo depletion results with 37,800 depletion cells are provided by MCS within acceptable calculation time and memory usage. The results show that at least 7 axial meshes per fuel plate are required to reach the same precision as the reference calculation whereas no significant differences are observed when modeling 1 or 10 radial meshes per fuel plate. This study demonstrates that MCS can address the need for Monte Carlo codes capable of providing reference solutions to complex reactor depletion problems with refined meshes for fuel management and research reactor applications.

The designed device generates vibration energy with much higher frequency than ambient vibration frequency, which uses the magnet to impact periodically on the piezoelectric cantilever with the top electrode of electrostatic element. The dynamic model of the hybrid energy harvester is established, and performances are experimental tested under the sinusoidal excitation and practical application environment. The results show that multi-mechanisms composite structure can realize the complementary advantages of electrostatic-piezoelectric-electromagnetic mechanisms and improve the energy conversion efficiency effectively compared with a single harvesting mechanism. The fabricated harvester can output electric energy in the frequency range of 1?38 Hz, which significantly reduces frequency dependence, and the maximum power is measured to be 11.7 mW and 12 mW during cycling and walking respectively, which is the sum of the power generated by three different elements. Furthermore, the fabricated prototype can also light up six light-emitting diodes (LEDs) simultaneously when handy shaking.

The time-varying characteristics of sEMG can induce errors in related applications such as force/torque estimation, detection of muscle fatigue, and pattern recognition. We investigated the effects of long-term wrist contractions on the classification accuracy of stroke patients in fatigue. Seven stroke patients participated to repeatedly perform sessions of four isometric wrist movements, namely, flexion, extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation in different sessions until exhaustion over 4 days. Each movement was successively performed by 60 s with 30 s of rest. To avoid excessive muscle fatigue, subjects were asked to perform each movement at 20% of the maximum voluntary contraction. We classified the four types of wrist movements using an artificial neural network and investigated variations of sEMG features in fatigue. The results showed that not only the classification accuracy but also the manifestation of muscle fatigue from sEMG remained consistent during long-term contractions in fatigue. The average classification accuracy for all patients was 0.91 ± 0.07 without significant difference between sessions.

To date, ensuring part quality and process control for low-volume AM productions is still critical because traditional statistical techniques are often not suitable. To this aim, extensive research has been carried out on the optimisation of material properties of SLM parts to prevent defects and guarantee part quality. Amongst all material properties, defects in surface hardness are of particular concern as they may result in an inadequate tribological and wear resistance behaviour. Despite this general interest, a major void still concerns the quantification of their extent in terms of probability of defects occurring during the process, although it is optimised. Considering these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach to quantify the probability of occurrence of defects in hardness-optimised parts by SLM. First, three process variables, i.e. laser power, scan speed and hatching distance, are studied considering their effect on hardness. Design of Experiments and Response Surface Methodology are exploited to achieve hardness optimisation by controlling process variables. Then, hardness defect probability is estimated by composing the uncertainty affecting both process variables and their relationship with the hardness. The overall procedure is applied to AlSi10Mg alloy, which is relevant for both aerospace and automotive applications. The approach this study proposes may be of assistance to inspection designers to effectively and efficiently set up quality inspections in early design phases of inspection planning.

This work develops a new manufacturing method?micro-rolling forming to machine inverted pyramid LESs with high efficiency and low cost. In this method, a roller with closely arrayed micro pyramid teeth is designed and rolled on a copper substrate. A finite element model is established to analyze the forming process of the inverted pyramids and the forming process can be divided into four stages: elastic stage, yielding stage, hardening stage, full plastic deformation stage. The stress and strain mainly concentrate on the contact zone with the micro tooth abdomen. In this contact zone, the stress plateaus in the full plastic deformation stage are high and long, which drives the inverted pyramid formation. The side length of the inverted pyramid increases, while the cone angle decreases with the rolling depth increasing. Whereas the side length and cone angle vary slightly with the rolling speed increasing. The better rolling depth and speed for LES forming are 0.3?0.4 mm and 10?20 mm/s, respectively.

In this paper we developed a full analytical model of a piezoelectric actuator which includes piezo stack elements and a three-stage amplification mechanism. The model was derived separately for each unit of the system. Next, the units were combined, while taking into account their coupling. The hysteresis phenomenon, which is significant in piezoelectric materials, was extensively described. A number of hysteresis calculating algorithms were investigated and a new simple method of examining piezoelectric hysteresis was demonstrated. The theoretical model was verified in a laboratory setup. This setup includes a piezoelectric actuator, measuring devices and an acquisition system. The measured results were compared to the theoretical results, while taking into account the nonlinear phenomena of the piezoelectric materials and the three-stage amplification mechanism, and were found to be very similar. Due to its simplicity, this model can easily be modified in order to be applied to other PEMs or other amplification mechanism methods. The main novelty of this work lies in its system-level approach for piezoelectric actuators. All of the system elements include non-linear phenomena, which mutually influence each other. First, each part of the system will be described separately and then, the combined subsystems and the coupling between their parts will be represented. Finally we treat this system as one whole unit.

Considering such principals, eight gripper mechanisms were designed and produced which can be classified as micro grippers due to their small workspace, precise grasping and holding abilities. Common characteristics of all the designs are that, without using any electric motor, the open?close operation is by virtue of shape-memory alloys. Each gripper is designed for different purposes with different operational principles of which four were initially open and the other four were initially closed configurations. Parametric studies were performed by changing the duty cycle and frequency of pulse width modulation using a signal generator followed by measurement of gripper jaw clearance, open?close period, average open?close velocities, gripping force, holding and lifting abilities of the designed gripper mechanisms. Jaw displacement and velocity parameters were computed by image processing of video records captured during the operation of the gripper mechanisms.

The split Hopkinson tensile bar (SHTB) is one of the most widely used devices for characterization of various materials under dynamic-tensile loading conditions. Since one-dimensional wave propagation in bars is disturbed by specimens and grips, however, SHTB measurement accuracy may not be guaranteed. This means that the stress?strain curve of the specimen that is calculated using strains at bars may not indicate the real stress?strain relation of the specimen. In this study, simulations for the SHTB test were carried out to investigate the effects of thread pitch, specimen length, specimen diameter, and thread inner diameter of the specimen on the measurement accuracy for two types of metals with medium and high yield strengths. Finally, specimen shapes are recommended for accurate measurement of the stress?strain relation of tantalum and tungsten carbide.

Because TBCs are subjected to repeated thermal stress at the coating interface under thermal fatigue conditions and eventually breakage, it is crucial to evaluate the thermal fatigue durability of TBCs according to the stress. In this study, coin-type TBC specimens were prepared by depositing commercial coating powders on Ni-based super alloys via the air plasma spray method, and the thermal fatigue life of the TBCs was experimentally evaluated. According to the test results and references, a finite-element analysis was conducted. The maximum stress of the TGO interface was evaluated according to the thickness and equivalent elastic modulus, and simulating the microstructure including the pores of the top coat. Using these relationships, a thermal fatigue life prediction equation considering the coating thickness (t), equivalent elastic modulus (E), and operating temperature (T) was derived, and subsequently verified.

The influence of three key parameters in the STP process including polishing speed, diamond abrasive size and diamond abrasive concentration were analyzed. To investigate the potential mechanical effect of the nanometre abrasive, nano-SiO 2 abrasive particles were added in the slurry, and the concentration of SiO 2 abrasive was also taken as a factor. Taguchi method was utilized to evaluate the influence of the four factors and optimize the polishing conditions. The surface roughness (Ra/Rz) was used as the evaluation index, and the optimized polishing conditions were verified through experiments. Diamond abrasive size has the most significant effect on Ra/Rz, followed by diamond abrasive concentration and then SiO 2 concentration, as the polishing speed has been selected and limited in a small variation rang according to the previous study. Based on the S/N average response analysis, the surface quality is the best under the conditions with 8000# diamond abrasive, 5 wt% diamond abrasive concentration, 90 rpm polishing speed and 10 wt% SiO 2 concentration. After 4 min polishing, the surface roughness Ra/Rz is reduced rapidly from 200.5/1374.6 to 4.2/22.1 nm without embedded abrasive particles on the surface of the black LT substrate. It also shows that the mechanical effect plays a dominant role in the material removal. A certain amount (10 wt% in this study) of nano-SiO 2 can reduce friction between solid colloidal and workpiece, and helps to improve surface quality.

One of the most common methods for CoM pattern generation is to approximate the robot’s complex dynamics as alinear inverted pendulum model, applies preview controls, and generates CoM trajectories. However, the vertical motion of CoM is neglected during this approximation process. In this study, we formulate the preview control problem considering the dynamics of the CoM vertical motion and propose an algorithm to solve it. The results of numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm show it is more stable than the existing algorithm and can be sufficiently fast for online operation.

Meanwhile, an adaptive iterative constant force control method based on one-dimensional force sensor is proposed to improve the processing quality and efficiency of robot belt grinding. Firstly, an error model based on 6 DOF robot is constructed. Then, considering the workspace of robot belt grinding and the similarity of robot position error, the Co-Kriging compensation algorithm is used to compensate the grinding trajectory, which makes the compensation process convenient and accurate. Then, a grinding dynamics model based on deformation is established, and an adaptive iterative constant force control is proposed for complex robot belt grinding process, which overcomes the instability of grinding force and shortens its convergence time. Finally, the grinding trajectory compensation experiment and the force control experiment of spherical workpiece are carried out. The results show that the space interpolation compensation algorithm based on Co-Kriging method can significantly improve both the space position error of grinding trajectory and the actual error of workpiece, which proves the feasibility of compensation algorithm. Through force control algorithm, the grinding force fluctuation is maintained within 2 N, the mean value, standard deviation and variance of absolute value of force error are significantly reduced, the convergence rate of grinding force and the roughness of workpiece are much better than before, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed force control algorithm.

Error functions of the 2D stage were obtained at 9 × 9 sample sites with repeatability of 43 nm and 22 nm, when the sample site intervals were 10 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively. Two error functions of the reference scale, obtained using the readouts of the 2D stage or a laser interferometer, coincided within 89nm and 15 nm for each sample interval.

In this study, we analyzed the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) performance and electric conductivity of composites fabricated by varying the size (mean size: 6-100 ?m) of graphite fillers and explained resulting attributes through the relative permittivity and geometrical characteristics of the filler. When the graphite/paraffine wax composite was fabricated using large-sized graphite (KS150), the spacing between the graphite fillers became widened, enabling electromagnetic waves to leak through the gap. The analysis results indicated that KS150 graphite exhibited an EMI SE performance of under 10 dB when the filler content was 30 wt%. However, when the content was increased to 50 wt%, the EMI SE performance improved sharply to 40 dB. In contrast, when the composite was filled with small-sized graphite (KS6), having a high ratio of surface to volume, the EMI SE performance was greater than that with the largesized graphite at low loading. The results related to the EMI shielding performance of graphite-filled composites revealed that the size of the filler greatly affects the EMI SE. The composite using KS75 showed an EMI SE performance of 53.0 dB and electrical conductivity of 2,000 S/m
ZnO/conducting polymer bilayer via sequential spin-coating for enhanced UV sensing;;박태현(가천대학교);최형욱(가천대학교),허재현(가천대학교);Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;한국화학공학회;The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers;202009;37(9);pp.1616~1622;Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles, PEDOT : PSS, Bilayer, Spin Coating, UV Sensor;;화학공학;0;;10.1007/s11814-020-0563-9;?Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been widely investigated as an important ultraviolet (UV) sensing material in view of its wide band gap (~3.4 eV). However, the fabrication of continuous thin films of ZnO generally requires complex, time-consuming, and expensive processes, such as sputtering and atomic layer deposition. Herein, we demonstrate a bilayer film consisting of a conducting polymer and ZnO nanoparticles sequentially deposited using a simple, rapid, and inexpensive two-step spin-coating process. In this approach, it is not necessary to have a continuous ZnO nanoparticle film as the active layer, because the conducting polymer deposited under the ZnO nanoparticles acts as a conductive and continuous supporting layer for the particles. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT : PSS) is used as the auxiliary layer to promote the efficient transport of photo-carriers generated from ZnO nanoparticles under UV light. As a result, under UV light (365 nm), photocurrents obtained from a ZnO/PEDOT : PSS bilayer film are significantly higher (~20 times) than that from a ZnO layer for a given voltage bias. The photoelectric performance can be further tuned by controlling the speed of spin-coating in the deposition of ZnO nanoparticles. The stability and photo response (rise and decay time) of the ZnO/PEDOT : PSS bilayer film under the repeated on-off condition are also reported.

The concept is to design a feedback controller without using position signals of the object instead using the voltage signals. In the working process of the electrostatic suspension system, the capacitance formed between the electrode and the suspended object is treated as a capacitor of two parallel plates, and if the gap length between them is changed the capacitance is then changed. This causes to change the voltage across the capacitance formed between the electrode and suspended object. This voltage is measured, and it then is used to estimate all variables of the system that are the displacement, velocity of the suspended object, and voltage across the capacitance formed. These estimated values are employed in the feedback schema instead of actual states values. The design of the controller follows the classical observer state-space approach. First, a state feedback controller is constructed with the assumption that all the state variables of the suspension system that are displacement, velocity of the suspended object, and voltage across the capacitance formed by the electrodes and the suspended object, are available for feedback. Second, a full observer is designed for estimating all the states from the measured voltage across the capacitance. Finally, the estimated signals produced by the full observer are used in the feedback controller instead of the actual states, and the self-sensing electrostatic suspension without using position sensors is achieved. The experimental and simulation results show that the suspended object successfully levitated at reference gap without using position sensors.

Hence, attention has been paid to the need for analysis and detection thiourea at very low concentrations. The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of electrochemical sensor based on glass carbon electrode modified with Ag nanoparticles and alizarin yellow to detect thiourea as a pollutant. Glass carbon electrode was first modified by alizarin yellow polymer and Ag nanoparticles through electropolymerization and chronoamperometry methods, respectively. The characteristics of the modified electrode were determined through FESEM and EDAX analysis and thiourea concentration was measured through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) methods. The results showed that the linear range, limit of detection, and sensitivity were 10 to 940 ?M, 3.3 ?M and 0.181 ?A/?M, respectively. The stability and reproducibility of the sensor response as well as the interference effect of some anion species were investigated on the performance of the sensor in determining thiourea. The results indicate the optimum stability and reproducibility and no interference effect of the studied species on efficiency of the sensor in determining thiourea.

The effects of [Co2+]/[Ni2+] ratio, gly concentration, pH, current density and temperature on the current efficiency, Co content in the coatings and on polarization behavior were investigated. It was found that the CCE of these baths has a wide range starting from 55% up to a maximum value of 99.3%, relying on the operating parameters and the bath constituent. However, the CCE decreased from 96.2% to 84.8% when the gly content was enhanced from 25 to 150 g/L. On the other hand, the Co content in the deposit reached 97% (wt%) at [Co2+]/ [Ni2+]=0.43, i=16 mA cm?2 , t=10 min, T=20 o C. The codeposition of Co and Ni from acidic gly baths obeys the anomalous type of codeposition. The kinetic results indicate that the Tafel slope increased in the case of alloy deposition, while both the transfer coefficient ?c and the exchange current io decreased. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that increasing the Co2+ content in the electrolytic solution has an inhibiting impact on the kinetics of the nickel-cobalt alloy plating. The throwing power is enhanced with enhancing [Co2+]/[Ni2+] ratios, while the addition of gly decre

The response surface method(RSM) was used to conduct experiments and establish the models of R a -Fd , R a -Td , and TWD under various cutting parameters. The significance of cutting parameters on R a -Fd , R a -Td , and TWD was analyzed by analysis of variance. It was observedthat the R a -Fd and R a -Td are mainly influenced by the spindle speed, depth of cut, transverse size and feed rate, while the TWD is mainly influenced by the depth of cut. A comparison of RSM-optimum function and artificial bee colony (ABC)algorithm optimum programming was conducted to obtain the best cutting conditions leading to minimum R a -Fd, R a -Td and TWD simultaneously. From the presented results, ABC algorithm was able to obtain the better cutting strategy. Finally, theperformance of the proposed cutting strategy was verified by confirmation experiments.

After exposing the PSf support to DMAc solvent, water pressure was applied onto the polymer support. As a result, the sponge-type structures were connected to each other and the porosity of the modified PSf increased. In addition, the support pressurized for 3 minutes at 8 bar had the highest value of 133 L/m2 h and removal rate of 95.0% for sodium alginate filtration test. When the PSf support was immersed in an organic solvent, the interaction between the chains of the PSf was weakened, while when water pressure was applied, pores were generated. These results were confirmed by SEM, FT-IR and porosimeter data.

In this paper, synthetic hydrophilic rod-like porous nano-hydroxyapatites (PNHAs) were doped into polysulfone (PSf) casting solution to form support layer by phase inversion; further interfacial polymerization was carried out to prepare a high performance TFC FO membrane. The results showed that the incorporation of PNHAs not only improved the thickness, porosity, hydrophilicity, and connectivity of the support layer, but also enhanced the roughness of the active layer. The measured mass transfer parameters prove that these improvements were beneficial.
Further FO experiments showed that when using deionized water as the feed solution and 1 mol/L NaCl as the draw solution, TFN 0.75 showed higher water flux than TFC FO membrane in both AL-FS (18.5 vs 7.16 L/m2 ·h) and AL-DS (33.26 vs 9.93 L/m2 ·h) modes. Reverse salt flux had not increased significantly. At the same time, TFN 0.75 (697 ?m vs 1,960 ?m) showed the smallest structural parameter.

The moisture removal process absorbs moisture from natural gas using glycol as an absorbent, and the recycling process then separates moisture from the H2O-rich glycol in a regenerator column by applying the principle of vapor-liquid equilibria. For the dehydration process of a natural gas plant, the heat and mass flows are properly established and calculated by means of a static process model for a utility system embedded in the process based on the properties of natural gas. The results of the calculation generate a T-H composite curve that can be used to compare the pinch and to assess the installation and operating costs for the target temperature. The results show that approximately 61% of the total heat supply can be replaced with low-pressure steam, depending on the optimization of the heat exchanger network of the moisture removal process. Further, the annual operating costs can be reduced by about 17% in this case.

NF membranes were prepared from the incorporation of different concentrations of the synthesized composite nanoparticles into the polyether-imide (PEI) as the membrane matrix. The prepared membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Moreover, the separation performance of the NF membranes was examined by pure water flux (PWF) and the separation of Na2SO4, Pb(NO3)2, Cr(NO3)2 and Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solutions. The results showed the increase of pure water flux due to present hydrophilic groups on the membrane surface. The highest pure water flux obtained was 22.03 L/m2 h in 1 wt% of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the rejection of Na2SO4 and Pb(NO3)2, CrSO4, and Cu(NO3)2 improved to 78%, 64%, 67% and 66% that increased 11%, 33%, and 22%, and 39% compared with the pristine PEI membrane, respectively.

Moreover, the produced biosorbent can easily separate from the solution by using an external magnetic field. Five isotherm models--linear adsorption model, Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, and Toth--were used for describing the results; and based on Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity of the produced biosorbent is 164.7 mg/g for Pen-G and 229 mg/g for AMB.

The current paper reports the development of an apparatus for solid-liquid extraction of cellulases from solidstate fermentation (SSF) carried out in a packed bed bioreactor (PBB), operated as batch and as semicontinuous. The case study was the cultivation of Myceliophthora thermophila I-1D3b on sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and wheat bran (WB) (7 : 3 w/w). The current work integrates the PBB to the first downstream step for recovering the enzymes produced by SSF. The substrate was inoculated and packed into the modules that composed the PBB. The fermentation occurred at 45 o C and air was supplied with flow rate of 350 L/h. At the end of the cultivations, each module was placed in an extraction column, a dynamic closed system in which distilled water was circulated and made to percolate the cultivated material. Variables tested were volume of water per mass of substrate, water flow rate and time of percolation.
Higher contact time (120 min) and higher flow rate (2.4 m³/h) allowed us to recover up to 85% of total enzyme activity by percolation. Lower volume (20 mL/g) provides higher titer extract. The apparatus showed to be promising for SSF downstream, mainly for semicontinuous operation of PPBs."

Improving primary sludge dewaterability by oxidative conditioning process with ferrous ion-activated peroxymonosulfate;;Xu Zhou(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen));Wenbiao Jin(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)),Lan Wang(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)),Wanqing Ding(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)),Chuan Chen(Harbin Institute of Technology),Xijun Xu(Harbin Institute of Technology),Renjie Tu(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)),Song-fang Han(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)),Xiaochi Feng(Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)),Duu-Jong Lee(National Taiwan University);Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;한국화학공학회;The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers;202009;37(9);pp.1498~1506;Dewaterability, Oxidative Conditioning Process, Peroxymonosulfate, Primary Sludge, Ferrous;;화학공학;0;;10.1007/s11814-020-0517-2;Enhancement of sludge dewaterability is key for sludge management and disposal of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In this study, the Fe2+-peroxymonosulfate (PMS) conditioning approach was first used to oxidize the primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tank of a full scale WWTP. The combination of Fe2+ (0.05-0.5 g/g TSS) and PMS (0.05-0.5 g/g TSS) could significantly improve the dewaterability of primary sludge. The optimal addition amount of Fe2+ and PMS was 0.1 g/g TSS and 0.25 g/g TSS, respectively, under which the capillary suction time (CST) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of the sludge was reduced by 79% and 95%. The physicochemical properties (particle size, zeta potential, EPS composition) of the primary sludge before and after oxidative conditioning were measured. Results showed that sulfate radicals generated from Fe2+-PMS system effectively reduced organic matter in different EPS fractions, further destroying sludge floc cells. Then the bound water in the sludge flocs was released, thereby improving the sludge dewaterability. The microscopic morphology also indicated that the sludge flocs have a blocky structure with tight texture before conditioning. After conditioning, the sludge flocs become smaller, and many irregular pores are formed on the surface, which facilitates the passage of internal moisture. Economic analysis showed that Fe2++PMS conditioning is more economical than the traditional Fenton method.
Coke combustion kinetics of spent Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation;;Pajri Samsi Nasution(한경대학교);정재원(한경대학교),오경석(인하공업전문대학),고형림(한경대학교);Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;한국화학공학회;The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers;202009;37(9);pp.1490~1497;Coke Combustion, Propane Dehydrogenation, Pt-Sn/Al2O3, Thermogravimetry, Activation Energy;;화학공학;0;;10.1007/s11814-020-0536-z;The kinetics of coke combustion was investigated by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) of coked catalysts which was used for propane dehydrogenation to determine the activation energy. Apart from the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, four different Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by varying the Pt/Sn ratio from 3 : 0.5 to 3 : 3 by weight. The catalytic activity was measured by propane dehydrogenation at 620 o C. The reactant mixture consisting of C3H8 (30 ml/ min) and H2 (30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor for 5 h. A thermogravimetric analyzer in the presence of air was used to determine the amount of coke deposited and calculate the kinetic parameters for coke combustion. Three nonisothermal models (Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose) were used to determine the activation energy and the best model to fit the experimental data. The FWO model provided the best fit for 3Pt/Al2O3 and 3Pt-0.5Sn/Al2O3. The three models were equivalent for fitting the data for 3Pt-1Sn/Al2O3, 3Pt-2Sn/Al2O3, and 3Pt3Sn/Al2O3. The activation energy increased with increasing Sn addition in the 3Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Differences in the locations and the qualitative features of the cokes were suggested to interpret the results.

Three novel deep eutectic solvents (DTAC-PTSA, DTAC-2PTSA, DTAC3PTSA) were successfully prepared by mixing dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DTAC) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (PTSA) in a molar ratio of 1: z (z=1, 2, 3). After testing, DTAC-3PTSA was found to have the best catalytic performance among the three types of DESs and was therefore selected as the catalyst for subsequent experiments. The effects of agitation speed, ethanol to palmitic acid molar ratio (?), temperature and catalyst dosage were studied by investigating the change of palmitic acid conversion rate with time under different conditions, respectively.
Then, the pseudo-homogeneous (PH) model was utilized to describe the kinetic behavior of this reaction between 328.15-348.15 K and it was found to work well for the experimental data obtained. Moreover, the catalytic performance of DTAC-3PTSA was detected to have no significant change in the cycle test. Therefore, DTAC-3PTSA can be considered as a substitute for traditional catalysts to produce biodiesel and the kinetic data obtained here can be used for further up-scaling study"

Enhanced tubes (elliptical tubes with a built-in turbulator) instead of a smooth tube were used and TiO2-water nanofluids were substituted for water to intensify the heat transfer. The influences of turbulator (presence or absence), axial ratios of elliptical tubes (Z=1.235, 1.471, 1.706), nanoparticle concentration (?=0.0 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.3 wt%, 0.5 wt%), and Reynolds number (Re=400-12,000) on the flow and heat transfer properties of TiO2-water nanofluids were studied. Thermal and exergy efficiency were used to research the comprehensive thermo-hydraulic characteristics of these heat transfer enhancement technologies. The thermo-hydraulic properties of nanofluids all showed an increasing trend with the growing axial ratio, nanoparticle concentration and Reynolds number. Nanofluids (?=0.5 wt%) in an elliptical tube (Z=1.706) with a built-in turbulator showed the best thermal performance, which could be increased by 33.8% in comparison with water at best. The thermal efficiency index increased first and then decreased with the Re. Nanofluids in elliptical tubes with a built-in turbulator can clearly promote heat transfer under the identical condition.

A modified numerical scheme is proposed to simulate the corresponding electrochemical system which is governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. Seven types of geometries and various flow fields with Reynolds numbers up to 2100 are considered. The obtained results indicate the current numerical method can successfully simulate the increase of current density on the cathode as the applied potential cell increases, and that rise will continue until the limiting current density is reached. To predict the effect of fluid flow, the proposed scheme is applied for various Peclet numbers. The increase of current density for Peclet numbers between 1 and 104 is quite evident. But for large Peclet numbers between 104 and 107 , the current density increases gradually. The results also show that as the anode size is doubled, the maximum current density occurs at the leading and trailing edges. However, if the cathode size is doubled, the maximum current density occurs at the center regions of it. Knowing the regions where current density is extremum helps electochemical system designers to control the parameters of the corresponding process.

PVS was analyzed in terms of nutritional composition such as fiber, ash, protein, and fat, which not only played a role in dye adsorption but also provided solid matrix for fungal growth. Five dyes, namely, crystal violet (CV), methylene blue (MB), reactive black 5 (RB), indigo carmine (IC), and direct red 80 (DR), were tested as adsorbates but only CV and MB were effectively adsorbed.
Effect of sorbent dose, contact time, dye concentration, and NaCl on adsorption was investigated individually. Langmuir model was suitable for fitting MB adsorption, while adsorption of CV adopted the Freundlich model. The adsorption capacity was calculated to be 625 mg/g for CV and 303 mg/g for MB, respectively. The adsorption process of both dyes was spontaneous and endothermic, and the adsorption followed pseudo 2nd order kinetic model and film diffusion model. The dyed PVS was finally cultivated with fungus Pycnoporus sp., wherein efficient dye decolorization was attained under solid state fermentation. As such, PVS coupled with subsequent fungal degradation might serve as novel alternative for dye effluent treatment."

A Functionallygraded (FG) pure aluminium/Al2O3 tube was processed by horizontal centrifugal casting method. The hollow tube dimensionsare 230 mm outer diameter x 12 mm thickness x 180 mm length. The properties of these FG tubes were comparedwith unreinforced alloy. Hardness and tensile results in the radial direction showed that the hardness and tensile inaccordance with the gradient microstructure was improved from inner zone to outer zone. Wear tests were carried out fordifferent test duration at a constant sliding speed of 8 m/s and loads applied are 14, 24 and 40 N. In all test conditions thewear rate in the outer layer was minimum compared to other layers. In the surface analysis, scanning electron microscopeindicated the presence of delamination, wear debris and cracks. FG tubes reinforced by Al2O3particles have increasedmechanical properties and wear resistance compared to its unreinforced alloy (matrix alloy) and is suitable for use inautomobile and transport applications.

It is possible to obtain complex shapeof materials by this method and unconventional microstructures can be achieved due to its thixotropic properties. However,in this study thixoforming was used not only as forming method but also as a manufacturing method.

Amorphous samples of Zr57Cu-20Ni8Al10Ag5 were prepared in copper molds with different sizes in order to obtain different cooling rates for both HRRFand traditional cast methods. These specimens were subjected to compression experiments, including microhardness testing,X-ray diffraction testing and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The results indicate that the plasticity of the samplesformed by HRRF are higher than that of the as-cast ones at the same cooling rates, while the microhardness manifests theopposite principle. As the cooling rate increases further, the difference in plasticity further increases between two methods,indicating that the plasticity of metallic glasses is more sensitive to cooling rates during the HRRF process. At the core ofthis phenomenon is the fact that HRRF methods can introduce more free volume into glasses than traditional cast methodswith an elevated cooling rate are able to.

However, to bondreliably, a sintered Ag joint needs a suitable metallized substrate (e.g. gold or silver) and the application of pressure duringsintering. Hence, we investigated the evolving microstructure (i.e. the importance of pore shape factor) and shear strengthof micron-Ag joints bonded without pressure on copper, Ag-plated substrate, and direct-bond copper (DBC) thermally agedat 300 °C for 1000 h. The DBC substrate maintained die-shear strength better because its coefficient of thermal expansionmatched those of the sintered Ag and Si dies. Regardless of substrate, micron-Ag joints showed a decrease of large pores(> 0.16 μm2) and an increase of spherical pore shapes during the aging period. These favourable changes maintained themechanical integrity of the micron-Ag joints. This evolving microstructure of the sintered Ag joint provides guidelines forpackaging engineers to consider as part of their selection of metallizations and substrates for power electronic packaging.

According to the national statistics, heart disease is a major cause of death in Korea. Considering the risk factors and characteristics of heart diseases, constant monitoring of hear conditions is essential for the patients with cardiovascular diseases. This study designed and implemented a portable ECG measurement device (PEMD) that can monitor heart health in everyday life by wearing the device on a fingertip. To evaluate the performance of this portable heart health monitoring system, two different commercial sensors that measure heart rate and blood pressure were selected for correlation analysis. For the feasibility study experiment, 5 healthy volunteers in their 20s were recruited. To induce changes in the subjects’ heart rate (HR) and R-R interval time, 5 experimental conditions (at rest (C), right after running (E1), right after drinking a shot of espresso (E2), 10 minutes after espresso (E3), 20 minutes after espresso (E4)) were randomly selected for each subject. To evaluate PEMD’s detection performance of the R peak and R-R intervals in ECG signals, Bland-Altman plots and ANOVA were used to analyze the differences in the 5 conditions of 5 subjects. Results showed a very high consistency (95%) between the values measured by the three sensor devices, suggesting that PEMD and its monitoring system tested in this study are able to detect meaningful changes in HR, R peak, and R-R interval times after running on a treadmill and taking caffeine. Further study considering personal lifestyle and amount of daily coffee intake on more number of people together with higher level of signal processing and noise filtering functions of the sensor are needed.

The plates of Al?Ce?Si?Mg aluminiumalloy were friction stir welded using a non consumable, rotating tool with triangular profile pin and circular shoulder, withdifferent combinations of tool rotation speeds and weld speeds. The microstructure, hardness and mechanical properties ofthe weld were analyzed. The microstructure of the weld zones revealed that, the average grain size at the bottom of the NuggetZone (NZ) is 5 ± 0.12 μm and gradually increases to 15 ± 0.23 μm at the top of the NZ. In the TMAZ the grain size is20 ± 0.14 μm and is bigger compared to the NZ. In the HAZ, the grain size is around 37 ± 0.21 μm and is bigger than that inthe TMAZ. The maximum Vickers hardness value at the NZ center is 231.9 ± 2 Hv, and uniformly reduces to 100 ± 2.4 Hvin the TMAZ and 65 ± 1.3 Hv in the HAZ and then increases to 98 ± 1 Hv in the base material (BM). The maximum ultimatetensile strength (UTS) of FSW joint was found to be around 102.55 ± 3 MPa with elongation at fracture of 2.5%. The BMUTS was 154 ± 4.5 MPa. For a tool rotation speed of 800RPM and a weld speed of 20 mm/min a maximum joint efficiencyof 67%. was obtained. Hence these were chosen as the optimum process parameters to join the alloy Al?Ce?Si?Mg by FSW.

It was found that increasing the plasma discharge intensity during ball millingobviously promoted the formation of a thin flake-like W phase because of the electroplasticity effect and simultaneouslylowered the carburization temperature between W and C. A combination of high hardness and transverse rupture strength of92.9 HRA and 3659 MPa, respectively, was obtained for the WC?8Co alloy fabricated by plasma milling at a gas pressure of5 × 103 Pa with a dielectric barrier discharge layer thickness of 3 mm. These properties were mainly attributed to the markedlylowered activation energy of the WC phase and generation of highly oriented ultrathin plate-like WC grains by plasma milling.
The combination of the flake-like structure of the plasma-milled W aggregate and high specific interfacial area and shortdiffusion distance of W/C were readily inherited by the ultrathin plate-like WC grains in the sintered WC?Co hardmetals."

The results show that twinningnucleation and area fraction are promoted significantly with the c-axis of grains rotating from the transverse direction to therolling direction. More importantly, twin propensity and the selection of twin variants can be well explained by the GSFthat is calculated based on an estimated stress state for rolling. The present results provide some insights into controlling themicrostructure and texture of Mg alloys by rolling processes.

In the IPT system, bifurcation can occur for various reasons, and when bifurcation occurs, the operating area is shifted from ZVS to ZCS. In this process, the large reverse recovery charge of the MOSFET causes a very large current spike, which can cause the device to burn out. To avoid this, an additional sensor and a switching frequency shift algorithm must be applied. To solve this, the characteristics of the GaN FET, which is known to have a reverse recovery charge amount close to 0, are compared with that of a silicon MOSFET, and the spike current generation during ZCS region transition due to bifurcation is analyzed through simulation.
The validity of the analysis is verified experimentally through a 2 kW prototype IPT system, and the experimental results shows that the current spike generated under bifurcation conditions is reduced by about 75% compared to the silicon MOSFET."

The resultsshowed that the alloy microstructure and martensitic transformation are strongly influenced by the aging temperature ratherthan aging time. During aging at 350 °C the alloy was prone to both the precipitation of the γ2 phase and the bainitic transformation,resulting in a loss of martensitic transformation and damping capacity. The prolonged aging at 350 °C caused adecomposition of parent phase into the equilibrium γ2 phase alongside the α phase which produced a significant hardnessincrement. On the other hand, aging at 250 °C affected the microstructure only slightly producing insignificant shift in thetransformation temperatures. It was found that, the secondary phases including Ti-rich X-phase and the RE-rich phase werenot influenced by the aging process. The results prescribe a high temperature order of the stability of martensitic transformationfor this new alloy which is important for its high temperature shape memory applications.

An extensivemicrostructural characterization was performed to evaluate the localized corrosion properties of the fusion zones. Thepotentiodynamic polarization test and salt spray test showed that the corrosion resistance decreases with increasing Mg content,therefore, the corrosion resistance of FZ-3 is lower than that of the FZ-1 and FZ-2. The electron microscopic analysisafter intermittent corrosion test revealed that the eutectic β-phase (Al3Mg2) was responsible for the initiation of corrosion.
The corrosion behavior of each microstructural constituents was related to the dissolution potentials of the correspondingmicrostructures; hence, it forms galvanic couple with the Al matrix. Moreover, high Mg content in the filler wire lead to theformation of additional β-phase in the fusion zone. However, intermetallics such as Al6(Fe,Mn) and Mg2Siwere significantonly during the later stages of corrosion."

Moreover, in the Third Energy Master Plan, the target share of renewable energy by 2040 was increased to 30-35%. The increase in the capacity of small-and medium-sized photovoltaic power stations (PV) is the highest among different renewable energy sources. As the output of PV power stations varies considerably, linking them with energy storage systems(ESSs)is attracting attention. When designing a PV-ESS, as the investment costs are high and the applicable support policies vary with the purpose of operation, it is important to review the economic feasibility of various models before installation. However, conducting this review might be very complex and difficult for the operator. Accordingly, the present study introduces a design program for distributed resources (MODDER) that can select the optimal capacity and business model considering the domestic policies and the operating characteristics of the distributed resources. The program comprises a database of weather information, load patterns according to application, sales unit costs, electricity rate unit costs, and renewable energy system specifications and can conveniently analyze the economic feasibility of a PV-ESS by selecting and configuring it according to the user’s purpose. Accordingly, the program helps determine the optimal capacity and business model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed program, through a case study, simulations of a demand side management business and a renewable energy generation sale business were conducted based on actual industrial customers, and the results were analyzed. The developed program can be used to maximize the return on investment of renewable power generation and ESSs, thereby reducing investment risk and contributing to improving the acceptance of renewable energy.

The structural and mechanical characteristics of the boride layers formed on thesurface were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, 2Dsurface profilometry, microhardness and electrochemical corrosion (3.5 wt% NaCl) tests. The boride layer exhibited a singlephase structure (Fe2B) in samples coated at 800 °C and a dual-phase structure (FeB + Fe2B) at higher boriding temperatures(900 and 1000 °C). The boride layers were compact and crack-free in all boriding conditions. Depending on boridingparameters, the thickness, hardness and average surface roughness (Ra) of the coatings were found to range between 5.81and 102.46 μm, 1635?1915 HV and 0.315?0.650 μm, respectively. The borided AISI H13 steel displayed up to 33.5 timesand 2.4 times higher corrosion resistance than untreated AISI H13 steel and martensitic AISI 431 steel, respectively. Thissuggests potential use of borided AISI H13 steel in the steam turbines and marine applications as an alternative to the morecostly martensitic and duplex stainless steel grades. The corrosion resistance depended on the phase structure (single- ordual-layer), density, thickness and surface roughness of the boride coatings.

As such, multinational companies promote their efforts into the energy transition by unveiling their objectives and attainment of voluntary renewable energy 100% (RE 100). The establishment of their goals for RE 100 is likely to obligate their business partners to encourage wider use of renewables while the corporate sourcing conditions for renewables and institutional strategies in Korea are still nascent. Accordingly, the arrangement of both effective measures to facilitate corporate renewable energy procurement and reasonable standards to validate the renewable electricity consumption is now required to keep domestic industries immensely competitive, simply not to fulfill the national target of green gas emissions. Though multiple procurement pathways vary across countries based on how they are implemented and detailed market rules and regulations, utility green tariffs, which have emerged recently in U.S. markets, are highly regarded as economical and stable options to meet renewable energy demand from corporations. Typically, in utility green tariffs, the utility procures renewable energy on behalf of the electricity customers, and they pay a special utility green tariff rate for the renewable energy service. Compared with other potential opportunities, utility green tariffs have an overwhelming advantage of reduced financial burdens on renewable energy purchases by realizing the renewable energy offerings with overall cost savings through enabling renewable generators to seek assurances that their investments in renewables should be returned on a long-term basis.
Finally, this paper purports to come up with a viable and vibrant green tariff mechanism in Korean electric power transaction frameworks and, at the same time, the overarching insights into various requirements considered to trigger this scheme in an amicable manner."

The martensitic stainless steel was hardened at different austenitizing andtempering temperatures. Microstructural analyses were carried out using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM?EDS) todefine the carbide distribution in the steel matrix. Carbides morphology and retained austenite content were evaluated andcorrelated to the corrosion behaviour of the different heat-treated steels, investigated by means of electrochemical tests. Theresults show the presence of M23C6and M7C3Cr-V based carbides homogenously dispersed in the matrix in annealed andquenching-and-tempering conditions. The carbides dissolution was evaluated by image analysis in every different heat treatmentcondition. When low tempering temperature was applied, an increasing in retained austenite content was defined byhigh austenitizing temperature and elevated carbides solubilization. At high tempering temperature, retained austenite contentwas not up to 5% nor affected by austenitizing temperature. Contrary to the expectations, HRC hardness was not influencedby the heat treatment conditions and retained austenite content. Corrosion resistance of the different heat-treated sampleswas found to be mainly influenced by retained austenite volume fraction and the tempering temperature. In particular, highaustenitizing temperature and low tempering temperatures allowed the best corrosion resistance among the different heattreatment parameters investigated. The results obtained in the experimentation can provide support to the heat treatmentoptimization of the steel, widely used in tool and mould applications.

For this, we investigated the issues of Korean LNG generators focusing on the profitability and reviewed some alternatives for overcoming these issues. Next, we calculated the minimum required variable cost margins for 23 Korean LNG generators, and obtained an average of 16.7 KRW/kWh. We also performed multiple regression and found that the investment cost, operation and management cost, and the allocation time for price-setting schedule energy(PSE) have statistically significant effects on the minimum required variable cost margin. Finally, we proposed a RPBP based on the results and analyzed the effect of the RPBP on the electricity market from the perspective of game theory. This study is academically and institutionally meaningful in that it is the first attempt to design the RPBP system using the real-world data of LNG generators.

To analyze the voltage characteristics due to the increase in distributed power connection, the voltage characteristics at the end of the test model were analyzed while increasing the distributed power capacity. The potential hosting capacity was analyzed by calculating the voltage margin up to the upper limit according to volt-var curve types with different reactive power contributions and dead-band. In addition, mounting the volt-var curve to many distributed generation connected to the distribution system faced a practical limitation. Considering this limitation, the voltage characteristics and hosting capacity margins for the penetration level of the volt-var curve were analyzed. In this paper, the effect of the volt-var curve was analyzed using OpenDSS, a quasi-static time-series simulation, considering the characteristics of the distribution system test model in the worst case.

In this work, those processes are automatized byusing a Sobel operator for identifying edges, which is normalized by different proposed Gaussian filters (on intensity, rugosity,or both). After that, a threshold is used to discretize the edges. Different neighboring pixel configurations, sensitive to edgeintensity, are proposed for thinning and cleaning the discretized edges, and hence, grain boundaries with a one-pixel thicknessare obtained. Then, the phase is selected by averaging color of each delimited grain. Finally, the precision on the phaserecognition was found to increase from 75.61 to 83.6% for the unmodified and the normalized Sobel operator, respectively.

By solving the computational problems required for planning, design and operation of the power system using a computer, it is possible to increase the quality of power system analysis, improve the efficiency of the power system operation, and increase the reliability of the power system. EMS (energy management system) includes many power system analysis applications, such as state estimation, power flow, stability analysis, fault analysis, economic dispatch and contingency analysis, which can analyze information for monitoring and control of the power system. In case of state estimation and power flow, their role is very important as application programs that are the basis of power system analysis. Commercial tools for power system analysis provide various visualization techniques for the expression of power system information and applications for grid analysis, but they do not usually include state estimation function as a basic application for power system analysis performed in a real-time environment. In addition, the cost of purchasing and maintaining commercial tools is very expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to use an educational application program that can be easily accessed and used by a user using computer in the educational stage for power system analysis. In this paper, we develop and introduce a program for power system analysis and education with information visualization function.

The softening mechanism was also discussed and the control strategy wasproposed in order to obtain optimum properties. Result showed that the average ferrite grain sizes of austenite rolling sheetand multiphase rolling sheet were 31.0 μm and 74.6 μm, respectively. The sheet after austenite rolling had a slightly higheryield and tensile strength while had a 6.3% higher elongation than that of the sheet after multiphase rolling. The higher dislocationin the sheet after multiphase rolling increased the strength while decreased the elongation. The softening mechanismof the sheet after multiphase rolling was the coarsening of ferrite grain. The combined role of {001} and {111} orientationresulted in a slight increase of the r and ?rvalue in the sheet after multiphase rolling. It was a wise choice to conduct rollingat the Ac1temperature in CSP process to increase the grain size and decrease the dislocation density. Then, the strength ofthe sheets could be further reduced and the elongation could also be improved.

This study presents the multi-objective optimization of the multi-passes cylindrical turning, where conflicting goals are simultaneously considered: economic, environmental and social sustainability. The first costs. The environmental impact was taking into account through the carbon dioxide emission. Finally, the key issue in the social sustainability was the operational safety. Also, the constraints resulting from the technical aspects of the turning process were also considered. From the decision-making point of view, an a posteriori approach was used, where the optimization process, which gives a Pareto front, is followed by the selection of the most convenient solution, depending on the specific workshop conditions. The nonsorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was used as optimization heuristic. The main contribution of the paper is the use of a tridimensional Pareto front for selecting the best cutting conditions, by considering the three pillars of the sustainability.

The experimental results demonstrate that the profile error can be reduced to 0.1 μm or a lower value in peak to valley (PV) after two compensation cycles. The on-machine measurement results show agreement with the off -machine measurement results when commercially available profilometers are employed. The study confirms the feasibility of the proposed wheel path determination method and the developed profile compensation approach. A mirror surface with roughness less than 8 nm in Sa is achieved.

The interface assists a human planner to effectively determine dispenser motion in a planning task. An augmented reality application prompts the planner with instructive information in a video of real environment while guiding the machine in 3D space to dispense glue on a work part. The purpose involves facilitating the generation of the dispenser’s motion commands by enhancing individual spatial reasoning between the dispenser’s tip and the work part. CAD models are not required prior to the planning task, thus eliminating the use of motion planning software. Test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed interface with respect to accelerating the process of the dispenser PbD. The study shows the practical value of augmented reality as a cost-effective interfacing technology for human?machine collaborations in smart manufacturing.

Material removal mechanisms of Cu?Co metal-powder composite involved in biomachining were explored. It was first observed that the pure cobalt and Cu?Co metal-powder composite were machined by the A. ferrooxidans. The material removal of three workpieces presented linear increase along the machining process due to the metabolic activity of the A. ferrooxidans. Different with the pure metal, the material removal mechanism of Cu?Co metal-powder is explained by the dual eff ect of micro-galvanic corrosion and participation of Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ for oxidization of cobalt.

In this study, volatile carbon dioxide (CO 2) is used as lubricant in order to replace mineral oil-based lubricants. CO 2 is injected into the void between the forming tool and the metal part through laser drilled microholes in the forming tool and acts there as a highly efficient lubricant. In order to investigate the tribological conditions during the drawing process, a new test bench having optical access to the CO 2 lubricant is designed, built and used in this study. Additionally, the CO 2 fl ow through the microholes is modeled using CFD simulation. Both the experimental and the theoretical study reveal a critical influence of the geometry of the microholes on the phase of the CO 2 in the forming tool and on the friction during the drawing process. Thereby, these investigations confirm that the CO 2 is in solid and/or gaseous state dependent on the surface pressure and the geometry of the microholes. Consequently, these results support the concept of microstructure-designed forming tools allowing dry metal forming for locally adjusted and environmentally friendly friction conditions.

Solid state recycling allows direct recycling of metal scraps into semi-finished products. It is expected that this process category would lower the environmental performance of metals recycling. Friction Stir Consolidation is a new solidstate technique taking advantage of friction heat generation and severe plastic deformation to consolidate chips into billets. In this research, the feasibility of Friction Stir Consolidation as aluminum chips recycling process is analyzed. Specifically, an experimental campaign has been carried out with varying main process parameters. Three main aspects have been evaluated in order to highlight products quality and environmental impact of the process: (i) metallurgical and mechanical properties of the consolidated products; (ii) primary energy demand, as compared to conventional processes; (iii) forgeability of the consolidated products, as compared to parent material. Results revealed that a proper process parameters selection results in fully consolidated aluminum disk with satisfactory mechanical properties. Also, the new recycling strategy allows substantial energy savings with respect the conventional (remelting based) route."

This method provides a design-for-remanufacturing approach, which offer solutions for product upgrade or repair. To be specific, a used part is first machined to remove material, and then additively deposited of materials on top. In this way, either the function of the part is upgraded or the broken part is repaired. Beneficially, the used part is economically and environment-friendly recycled. This method is developed under the level set framework and innovatively, the layer-wise level set representation of the additive manufacturing part is adopted for self-support and material anisotropy control. Especially for the latter point, the hybrid deposition path, a combination of contour-off set and zig?zag path patterns, is adopted for deposition path planning, which will be concurrently optimized for the best material anisotropy distribution. Therefore, what will be presented in this paper is a novel combination of structural topological design and process planning to derive the optimal hybrid remanufacturing strategy. This is a very novel trial and we have performed experiments to verify its effectiveness.

Here we introduce a design methodology of a nozzle to generate a beam of supersonic CO 2 solid nanobullets into the air at atmospheric pressure, which dislodge the contaminant particles by colliding with them. The dry cleaning scheme proposed here does not resort to the chillers, vacuum chamber, and carrier-gas handling system, which conventional dry cleaning systems often required and thus hampered their practical applications. We provide a theoretical framework to select key design parameters, such as the area ratio of the nozzle throat and exit and the supply gas pressure. We experimentally verify the superior capability of our nozzle in generating a CO 2 aerosol beam under the atmospheric back pressure condition. Additional process parameters including the stand-off distance and the incident angle of the CO 2 beam are optimized to maximize the cleaning efficiency and minimize the pattern damages. Our work suggests a practical nanoparticle cleaning scheme that is faster and simpler than the conventional dry cleaning methods.

It is proposed that radial-inflow/axial-outflow type turbines are well suited for micromachining spindles. To validate the turbine performance potential, a proof-of-concept prototype turbo-spindle was developed and experimentally tested. The prototype spindle produced a net mechanical power output of over 60 W at a speed of 90,000 rpm. The experimental results demonstrate a micro-turbine efficiency of over 50% and a turbine power output of approximately 100 W. This compares to a typical turbine efficiency of around 20% in commercial micro-machining spindles. Further potential improvements to both turbine and spindle energy efficiency are outlined.

The scaled model was originally designed and manufactured by researchers at the TechnicalUniversity of Munich. The model has been slightly modified to adopt the 3D printed blades for this study. Also, control algorithms for the power maximization in the low wind speed regions were constructed and applied to a commercialprogrammable logic controller for wind tunnel tests of the scaled model. For comparison, the scaled model was also modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and dynamic simulations were performed with the measured wind speed as an input. Thesimulation results seemed to overpredict the experimental results initially, but by considering the unexpected extra generator torque due to friction of the shaft, the errors were reduced to be less than 5%.

This requires very high precision machining of the parts and assemblies, such as electronics, vehicle and components,agricultural and construction machines, optical instruments, and machine tools. However, high precision machinery is quite expensive, and there exists a general need for low-cost equipment. While many researchers are working on this, their major focus is on cutting tools. This study aimed to compensate for errors and enhance machinery precision by adding a servo controller to the processing unit. Consequently, the study is on servo control and processing precision for processing utilizing ECTS (Error Compensation Tool Servo) to compensate for errors.

ABS films with a thickness of 60, 90, and 120 μm were prepared, and a crater measuring 100 μm or less was formed by irradiating a fiber laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm with a single pulse. The size of the craters is affected by the intensity of laser irradiation and the thickness of the film, and the heat dissipation layer reduces the change in size caused by the difference in the thickness of the film. For films with a thickness of 60 μm, it has been found that small craters of more than 10% can be obtained due to the heat dissipation layer. Thermal analysis showed in the ABS film without the heat dissipation layer, the maximum temperature increased to 373oC, but decreased to 261oC in the ABS film with the heat dissipation layer. With a decrease in the thickness of the film, the heat dissipation layer further reduces the pattern by laser irradiation.

Fatigue tests are performed to confirm the durability and damage tolerance of a composite aircraft structure. In particular, as composite materials have fatigue life variance larger than that of metallic materials, it takes a considerable amount of time to complete the aforementioned tests. Investigation of key factors such as spectrum truncation and load enhancement is required to create a load spectrum that can reasonably shorten the test time. In other words, criteria for removing the loads that have little effect on the fatigue life and applying factors for the severe load spectrum should be studied to produce the optimal load spectrum, which depends on the fatigue characteristics of the composite material. In this study, coupon tests and statistical analyses of carbon fiber/epoxy composites were performed to analyze the key elements and establish the criteria for the reliable truncation level and load factor for an optimal loading spectrum.

However, it is difficult to manufacture the desired shape due to section deflection and springback of the sheet. Section deflection is caused by the force of the blank holder for fixing the sheet and the tool for forming the sheet. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of the section deflection according to the geometries of the circular cup shapes in the sheet incremental forming process. The section deflection increased with an increase in the entering radius and forming angle in the section deflection region. However, section deflection was constant according to the exit radius. In addition, the secondary forming process for reducing the shape error was introduced. The secondary incremental forming process was conducted in the opposite direction. Characteristics of the shape error according to the entering depth of the tool among the forming parameters for reducing the shape error of the cup shape were analyzed. The springback in the cup-shape was reduced by the additional forming process with an optimum entering depth of the tool.

The ADoE framework, which is based on the Gaussian process, can effectively reduce the required number of an experiment while maintaining its accuracy. The proposed cost-aware sampling strategy augments the framework by selecting cost-efficient experiment points and the nonstationary surrogate model effectively reflects the nonlinearity of the system on the response surface model. The efficacy of the proposed framework has been validated through a virtual experiment using an actual high angle-of-attack wind tunnel test dataset, which is highly nonlinear.

For this purpose, the relationship between liquid viscosity and the stirring conditions, such as stirring torque, stirring speed, the duty ratio of PWM, impeller and beaker type, and the blade position in the beaker was analyzed. The second-order relationship between the stirring speed and torque, the linear relationship between viscosity and torque, and the linear relationship between duty ratio of PWM and stirring speed were observed, thereby indicating that the liquid viscosity could be estimated by an experimental formula based on the duty ratio and the stirring speed. In addition, the type of impeller and beaker was identified using the magnetic field inside impeller and RFID technology. For reducing the error in calculating the liquid viscosity, the employment of an impeller blade with a large rotational resistance and stirring with the blade at the center zone of the beaker were found to be necessary.

The manufacturing defects such as void defect and tow misalignments were considered in the model and the effect of their presence at different scale on the effective material properties were studied. The configuration of the finite element model was based on the geometric data extracted from an experimental test specimen. The representative unit cells (RUC) that repeat itself to build the whole braid were sliced out from the full interlaced geometry of axial and bias tows. Periodic boundary condition (PBC) was used to simulate the repeating nature of the unit cells. Then, numerical tests were performed to compute three-dimensional effective material properties for triaxial braided RUCs with predetermined void volume fractions and axial tow misalignment under uniaxial tension and shear loadings in different directions. It was observed that the void defects severely affected the out-of-plane properties of the material, while the tow misalignments influenced the axial modulus mostly.

Especially when precise work is required, additional information such as force feedback is very helpful for the operator. In transmitting such force information, a control device of exoskeleton-type with many points of contact with the human body can be one of the solutions. This paper proposes an optimal design method for the 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) exoskeleton systems. The proposed method optimizes the kinematic parameters by using kinematic performance indices related to the dexterity of the human and exoskeleton system. The manipulability ellipsoid is a representative index that can confirm the dexterity of the robot. In this study, we derived the objective function considering the human body model and then optimized it using a genetic algorithm. Unlike other HRI (Human-RobotInteraction) systems, exoskeleton robots share the end-effector as well as the base of the robot with the wearer. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the proposed performance index will be highly suitable for exoskeleton systems.

The weight of these structures has also increased due to their larger sizes. Reducing the weight of these structures can increase efficiency and lower fuel consumption, and decrease the structural load. Fabricating structures using composite materials is currently the most popular way to reduce weight. Several optimization algorithms are employed to achieve optimal composite structure design. A combination of these composite materials and a well-developed optimization algorithm can be effectively applied to improve the design of these larger composite structures. This study investigated the design of a composite spar and its feasibility by analyzing static conditions under extreme loads. Structural properties and stress analyses were calculated using the VABS program. Pre-processing and post-processing were performed by applying in-house MATLAB-based codes. The maximum stress failure theory was applied to check and confirm the composite laminate failure. A particle swarm optimization algorithm was also applied to analyze the design of the composite spar. The analysis results show that the proposed design method in this study is feasible and applicable to the design of composite spars for wind turbine blades and aircraft wings.

For this reason, interaction-aware vehicle trajectory prediction with uncertainty is essential before making a robust decision-making system and trajectory planner. In this paper, we present a probabilistic vehicle trajectory prediction algorithm, which is scalable, interpretable and accurate. Using past trajectory and the properties of the surrounding vehicles, the proposed model generates the distribution of the future predicted trajectory. Our model consists of a simple encoder-decoder architecture based on multi-head attention. Like human drivers, the model can learn which vehicles to focus on for accurate prediction without requiring supervision. Inter-vehicle interaction learning improves the interpretability of the prediction network. We demonstrate our model’s performance using a challenging, naturalistic trajectory dataset, showing clear improvement in terms of positional error on both longitudinal and lateral directions.

In this study, a new electrochemical oxidation (ECO) method, which oxidizes metal in DI water with a constant flowing current to both the cathode and anode, was developed to overcome the disadvantages of conventional oxidation methods. The mechanism of the ECO method is discussed. Metallic Zn films were oxidized by the ECO method in DI water for 1 h. The DI water temperature was varied from 30 to 90 oC to determine the optimal temperature for the ECO process. Increasing the temperature of the DI water led to distinct surface changes in the disk-shaped Zn plate. The intensity of diffraction peaks from the ZnO (002) plane gradually increased from 31.67 to 2806.48. The structural and optical properties of the ZnO thin film were enhanced as the temperature of the DI water approached 90 oC, which means that a high-quality ZnO thin film was synthesized using the ECO method at lower temperatures and shorter processing time compared with established oxidation methods. These results confirm the ECO method can be useful for the low-cost fabrication of transparent and flexible optoelectronic devices.

For this purpose, the principle of measuring the system model was used to analyze the compensating motion error component for line-profile and 3 types of MPES method (Integration-Method, the Fourier-Model-Method, and the Sequential-Method). The multi-probe-errorseparation-method (MPES) was applied to calculate the motion-error, which in turn was used to compensate for the measured linear-profile of the specimen. Lastly, the simulation conditions involving a multi-probe measurement system consisting of a reference-artifact, capacitive-sensor, and three displacement-sensors were designed and Monte-Carlo simulation was implemented for the evaluation of the 3 types of MPES method. Also, the simulation results obtained from the conventional measuring system and the proposed system were compared for the verification of the performance of the latter. Consequently, efficient compensation of the motion error appeared as possible and the applicability of the multi-probe measurement system was confirmed.

The pulse electroforming conditions of the aqueous solution chemistry were selected based on the aqueous copper-nickel-sulfur phase diagram and an evaluation of the deposition rate using the finite element method based on the current distribution in front of a cathodic electrode. The thermodynamic stability diagram revealed that the coppernickel multi-nano layers could be formed at pH<4 and ΔE>1.0 V in a modified sulfide bath. The electro-formed copper-nickel multi-layer was well produced at the pulse plating conditions of ?0.2VSHE, ?0.5 mA/cm2, and 25 seconds for copper layer and ?1.7 VSHE, ?50 mA/cm2 and 80 seconds for nickel layer, which was composed of about 25 nm thick copper and about 30 nm thick nickel rich phases, respectively. The average deposition rate of the copper-nickel foil with multi-nano layers was estimated by the finite element method to be about 0.115 mm/sec, which was in good agreement with the real value of the thin multi-nano layered copper-nickel foil.

To evaluate the feasibility of the air compressor to attenuate the aerodynamic drag, pressure transient and the micro-pressure wave, the flow around the high-speed train has been simulated using the unsteady axisymmetric compressible Navier?Stokes equation. The simulation results by the dedicated CFD program for the train-tunnel aerodynamics named C-STA™ showed good agreements with the field test result of Korea Train eXpress train running through the Bok-An tunnel. By adapting a compressor with 20% of the train cross-sectional area, the simulation results showed 9% reduced average aerodynamic drag, 54% reduced peak pressure rise in tunnel, and 20% reduced micro-pressure wave, which prove that adapting a compressor can be a good measure to attenuate the tunnel aerodynamic problems for high-speed train.

This makes it necessary to develop new soft magnetic materials capable of maintaining their characteristics even at high frequency. The purpose of this study is to minimize the heat generated by the eddy currents when charging, and to improve the charging efficiency under an alternating magnetic field. In this study, Fe-Si-B alloys containing Cu, Zr and Ca elements were melt-spun to prepare amorphous ribbons. The amorphous ribbons were heat treated to crystallize nanograins, The structure was analyzed by TEM and EELS, As a result, it was found that Zr was distributed mainly at the grain boundaries after heat treatment, whereas Ca was uniformly distributed only along the grain boundaries. It could be concluded that the Ca and Zr elements effectively suppressed the grain growth, and thus maintained the very fine nanograin structure.

Controller area network(CAN) is the most widely used protocol in in-vehicle network but it has limited bandwidth. CAN buses with limited bandwidth may increase in bus load due to the increased complexity of the CAN bus. Thus, low priority messages in CAN bus may be delayed or missed, making it difficult to predict the worst-case latency. There have been studies on data compression algorithms to reduce the amount of data transmitted on the CAN bus at a low cost. However, it is difficult to select the optimal compression algorithm because previous studies utilized different experimental environments, so it is difficult to compare performance across each study. This paper presents peak load and worst-case message latency when using representative data compression algorithms. Each algorithm was measured in the same experimental environment that implemented using CANoe in order to compare performance.

Also, it is a well-established fact in the existing literature that linear theories cannot be applied as in case of high aspect ratio wings because of non-linear increase in lift coefficient. The reason for such increase in lift and stall angle has been attributed to wingtip vortices that become prominent in low aspect ratio wings called the vortical lift which keeps on increasing up to a certain high angle of attack till it interacts with the separation bubble. In the past, very limited work has been done to study the vortices and their contribution in enhancement of aerodynamic characteristics. In the present work, flat plate model with corrugations at an aspect ratio (AR) of 1.0 are studied and compared with flat plate wing of AR 1.0; also flow visualization in water tunnel has been carried out at Reynolds number of 102 to ascertain the flow physics involved."

The graphene oxide was spray-coated on the Ag nanofiber film, which was fabricated by electrospinning process. Ag/poly(vinyl alcohol) ink was fabricated in a polymer matrix solution using the solgel method. The sprayed film was sintered at 200 oC for 100 min under H2/Ar atmosphere. The optical transmittance of the transparent electrodes was measured by UV/VIS spectroscopy, and sheet resistance was measured using I-V measurement system. As the amount of GO sprayed on the nanofibers increased, the diameters of the nanofibers increased, therefore, the transmittance of the electrode linearly decreased.
However, the conductivity of the electrode increased. This is because the sprayed GO filled the gap between the nanofibers, and GO deposited on the surface of the nanofibers will form more effective electron pathways, resulting in increased conductivity. The GO-Ag nanofiber electrode also exhibited excellent environmental stability, and the sheet resistance of the electrode remained very stable during 30 days testing. The lowest sheet resistance of the transparent electrode was 250 ohm/sq with approximately 83% transparency at a wavelength of 550 nm. This excellent electrical properties and environmental stability might facilitate applications of the GO-Ag nanofiber electrode in optoelectronic devices."

The proposed bush model adds amplitude-dependent cells to the generalized Maxwell model, the most general form of force element model for viscoelasticity. A frictional Maxwell model is used as the amplitude-dependent cell in which the damper element is replaced with a friction element in the Maxwell model. We establish a parameter identification process for this bush model and apply it to the front Mcpherson suspension. To verify the accuracy of the proposed bush model at the system level, half-car durability simulation based on multibody dynamics is performed on the suspension model equipped with the bush model. The results are compared with the accuracy of the suspension model using the Kelvin-Voight model, which is commonly used as a bush model.

As the acetylene flow rate increased, the penetration rate of carbon into the surface of the samples (surface-carbon flux) increased, resulting in an increase in the solute carbon concentration at the surface up to the solubility of carbon in austenite. At the same time, the amount of carbon diffusion into the interior of the specimen and overall carburizing depth increased. When the carbon concentration in the surface of the carburized specimen exceeded the solubility of carbon in the austenite above a certain flow rate, cementite precipitated in the austenite grain boundaries.
Accordingly, the surface hardness decreased and the amount of carbon diffusion into the specimen became constant as the solute carbon concentration in the austenite matrix at the surface of the specimen became constant. As a result, the overall solute carbon concentration and the effective case depth no longer increased.
Meanwhile, the tendency of vacuum carburizing behavior according to temperature was the same, but as temperature increased, the surface-carbon flux and rate of carbon diffusion into the interior of the sample increased, resulting in increased carburizing depth.

The AFS systems provide additional steering force with a Variable Steering Ratio(VSR) for easy steering. They also control the steering angle to allow the yaw rate to track the reference yaw rate. Lateral stability and steerability are also enhanced. The three AFS systems are designed with fuzzy logic control, sliding mode control and PID control. The results show that the AFS achieves very good kinematic steering assistance function and kinematic stabilization function. The VSR shows good performance when the SUV runs on a snow-covered road during deceleration. The three controllers exhibit similar performances but they improve the lateral stability and reduce response time during deceleration.

The chemically reacting gas flow around the orbital vehicle was simulated for actual reentry trajectories, with a computational solver based on the Navier?Stokes?Fourier equations. Hypersonic flows for a wide range of flying altitudes from 40 to 80 km were examined. We first analyzed important properties such as Mach number, trans-rotational temperature, vibrational temperature, chemical species composition, and surface properties such as the maximum heat flux for various altitudes. We then investigated the distribution of heat flux on the surface of the orbital reentry vehicle and the coupled effects of thermal non-equilibrium and chemical reactions on the hypersonic air flows. The computed heat flux results were compared with actual flight test data obtained during reentry of the orbital vehicle. The computed results were found to be in excellent agreement with the flight test data until an altitude of 60 km. Finally, we propose an explanation why heat flux was over-predicted around 70 km altitude but returned to better agreement at the higher altitude of 80 km. The phenomenon is based on two competing effects: the shortcoming of the first-order law of heat flux in the NSF equations and the inaccurate description of the effects of thermal non-equilibrium on chemical reactions in Park’s two temperature model.

This study revealed that the corrosion potential values of MgZn2 and Zn samples exposed to a 5 wt.% of NaCl solution were approximately -1.5 and -1 VSCE, respectively, and the MgZn2 showed a higher corrosion current density than Zn at the early stage of corrosion. The continued dissolution of MgZn2 phase from the eutectic structure in the coating layer provides not only sacrificial protection, but also environmental conditions for the co-formation of two types of corrosion products (simonkoleite (Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O) and hydrotalcite (ZnAl2(OH)6Cl2·H2O)) which have an inhibiting effect on the outer surface. The formation areas and kinetics of the two products on the coating surface were different, and they were greatly dependent upon the types of eutectic structures in the coating layer. Based on the results, a modified anti-corrosion mechanism of Zn-Al-Mg alloy coated steel sheet in chloride containing aqueous environment was proposed.

The proposed controller aims to optimally provide the in-wheel motor(IWM) torques to each wheel assisting the vehicle in following the desired trajectories. It includes a yaw rate reference for neutral-steering, which leads to enhanced cornering performance. A smooth sliding mode controller(SMC) is utilized based on a bicycle model to generate the desired yaw moment. Lastly, a torque distribution method with the Daisy-chaining allocation is utilized within an available torque operation area of IWM. Using the CarSim software, the proposed control algorithm is simulated. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using various driving scenarios. It is confirmed that some evaluation factors in cornering performance are improved.

Enormous attempts are made for fluid flow along cylinder but the study of fluid behavior along exponentially stretching cylinder is discussed lately. Using appropriate transformations, the governing partial differential equations are converted to non-dimensional ordinary differential equations. The transformed equations are solved numerically using Shooting technique with Runge-Kutta method. The influence of the physical parameters on the velocity and temperature profiles as well as the skin fraction coefficient and the local Nusselt number are examined in detail. The essential observations are as the fluid velocity decreases but temperature grows with rise in particle interaction parameter, and both the fluid velocity and temperature fall with increase in mass concentration parameter, Reynold number, Particle interaction parameter for temperature and the Prandtl number.

HAZ samples were fabricated using a metal thermal cycle simulator with a welding heat input of 20, 35, and 50 kJ/cm. The fractions of bainite and martensite-austenite (M-A) constituent in coarse-grained HAZ (CGHAZ) and intercritical HAZ (ICHAZ) obtained by a simulated thermal cycle with a low heat input (20 kJ/cm) were higher than those with a higher heat input. These fractions contributed to the increase in the reversible hydrogen trap density (N[H]rev) and reversibly trapped hydrogen concentrations (Crev). Although CGHAZ had higher N[H]rev and Crev meaning that it is more likely to be vulnerable to brittle failure by hydrogen, actual fracture by sulfide stress cracking (SSC) occurred in ICHAZ composed of a mixture of soft ferrite/pearlite, and hard bainite and M-A. The hydrogen diffusion/ trapping parameters, which were obtained from the electrochemical permeation or glycerin method, cannot be directly indicative of the resistance to SSC of the steel in a H2S environment. The susceptibility to SSC was more influenced by the level of M-A-localization and localized corrosion attack, acting as a stress intensifier under a tensile load.

A small airflow mass flow rate is bleed throughout a rotor-bleeding ejector which designed by seven parameters: bleeding angle (°) and ejection angles (°), ejection depth (D), bleeding thickness (H), bleeding position from rotor leading edge (L) in flow direction, bleeding ejection curvature (R), and bleeding width contacted on rotor shroud surface (W). The numerical results for aerodynamic performance: total pressure ratio, adiabatic efficiency, and stall margin of a transonic axial compressor were validated with a smooth casing experimental data. A parametric study of seven design parameters of rotor-bleeding ejector above combined with a small ejection mass flow rate in a single-stage transonic axial compressor for aerodynamic and structural performances was performed. The numerical results show that all aerodynamic performance increases with bleeding airflow from rotor shroud surface, the total deformation on rotor tip leading edge in spanwise direction reduces with a very small increasing in Von-Mises stress in a reference-bleeding airflow as compared to the results of smooth casing.

The correlation model used is a multiple linear regression model. To resolve multicollinearity that can cause overfitting, we use ridge regression, which is a normalization method. Interaction terms between independent variables are also added to the multiple linear regression model so that correlations between objective metrics can be considered. As an application of the proposed method, correlation modeling between subjective assessments and objective metrics of handling and steering feel is performed. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model, we compare it with a multiple linear regression model based on the least square method and a ridge regression model without interaction term. Results show the ridge regression with interaction terms has the highest accuracy in terms of coefficient of determination and mean square error.

Water quenching (WQ) after solution annealing (SA) and 20% cold rolled (CR) X-750 were prepared and these samples were subjected to ordering treatment at 475 oC for up to 2,160 hours. The WQ and CR specimens showed an exothermic reaction due to the release of entropy formed by the WQ and CR processes, respectively, whereas the ordered WQ and CR specimens exhibited endothermic reactions. The exothermic reaction from the WQ and CR specimens means the SRO reaction occurred. In the WQ specimen, two exothermic reactions at 577 oC and 671 oC were observed, which corresponds to SRO formation of Ni2Cr and CrFe, respectively. The critical temperature and thermal activation energy for these specimens were measured by varying the heating rate. The lattice variation with ordering time at 475 oC up to 2,160 hours was measured by XRD using CuKa X-ray. A 0.03-0.09% lattice contraction of the (200) plane occurred, depending on prior treatment condition. We discuss whether a lattice contraction due to SRO reaction may cause voids, providing formation sites for He bubbles in the X-750 garter spring exposed to the operating environment of the CANDU reactor.

These columns are mainly used to construct the structures with a large span and high floor height. Concrete filled tubes (CFTs) are a type of composite column, which are popular nowadays due to their numerous benefits. The purpose of this study is to investigate such frames at elevated temperatures. The method used in this research is based on section 2.2 of Eurocode 4. First, for the verification purpose, a comparison was made between the experimental results and the numerical model of the concrete filled tube. Then a composite frame was analyzed under fire temperature with different parameters. The results showed that the failure time decreased with increasing the friction of different models. Moreover, investigation of the concrete moisture content revealed that an increase in the concrete moisture content from 3% to 10% led to extended failure time for different models. For instance, in the second frame model, the failure time has increased up to 8%.

The geometric dimensions are designed for 100 W wind wheel with NACA0021 airfoil, whose trailing-edge thickness is 0.442%c (with c the chord length), and the simulation accuracy of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach is validated through comparing the calculated results of the Realizable k?ε turbulence model with experimental data. The blunt trailing-edge optimization of NACA0021 airfoil is performed by taking the maximum lift-drag ratio as the optimization objective, but the wind energy utilization of wind wheel with the optimized airfoil decreases with the increase of the trailing-edge thickness. Thus, the airfoil NACA0021 is modified to a sharp trailing-edge airfoil, namely, NACA0021S, and the wind energy utilization increases slightly. The airfoil’s relative camber is then increased by making the middle arc line locate on the circumference of wind wheel, and the effects of the relative camber on the pressure and vorticity distribution, torque, and wind energy utilization are analyzed. The results indicate that after the relative camber increases, the positive and negative pressure region areas decrease for NACA0021 and NACA0021S airfoils, and so do the length and distribution of the wake, but the torque coefficient and wind energy utilization increase.

In this study, SCC phenomena related to stress and corrosion composition were analyzed to identify the mechanism for SCC initiation and propagation in SS304. The microstructure and mechanical properties resulting from crack propagation were analyzed by OM, SEM/EDS and micro Vickers hardness tests. The abnormal phase transformation induced by the SCC was analyzed by TEM and diffraction. As a result of these analyses, the shape of SCC was observed to form a branched type crack, which was related to etch pit patterns on the etched surface due to the austenitic fcc (face centered cubic) lattice slip. In addition, the high concentration accumulation of Cl and S components at the SCC site, observed by SEM/EDS, indicated that the SCC was affected by the corrosive atmosphere. The SCC crack propagation was accompanied by hardening, which is believed to be associated with the mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement. High resolution TEM analysis found abnormal satellite diffraction points in the SCC high hardness region. This means that a superlattice phase with high hardness values is formed near the SCC region. And the HIC (hydrogen induced crack) effect, a kind of hydrogen embrittlement, was also influenced by the hardened superlattice phase. It is assumed that the SCC and HIC are similar phenomena produced in the same stress and corrosive atmosphere by superlattice phase transformation.

The shear connector is responsible for the interaction between these two parts. Recently, an alternative shear connector, called Truss Type connector, has been developed; it aligns efficient structural behavior, fast construction and implementation, and low cost when compared to conventional connectors applied in composite structures. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of the mechanical behavior of the Truss Type connector, due to its novelty. Thus, this study aims to analyze the influence of variation of geometric and physical parameters on the shear resistance of the Truss Type connector. In order to investigate those parameters, a non-linear finite element model, able to simulate push-out tests of Truss Type connectors, was specifically developed and validated with experimental results. A thorough parametric study, varying the height, the angle between rods, the diameter, and the concrete strength, was conducted to evaluate the shear resistance of the Truss Type connector. In addition, an equation to predict the resistance of the original Truss Type shear connector was proposed."

Shear stud connectors between steel and concrete are essential in composite members to guarantee the effectiveness of their behavior in terms of strength and deformability. This study focuses on investigating the shear stiffness of headed studs embedded in several types of concrete with wide range of compressive strength, and their effects on the elastic behavior of steel-concrete composite girders were evaluated. Firstly, totally 206 monotonic push-out tests from the literature were reviewed to investigate the shear stiffness of headed studs embedded in various types of concrete (NC, HPC, UHPC etc.). Shear stiffness of studs is defined as the secant stiffness of the load-slip curve at 0.5Vu, and a formulation for predicting defined shear stiffness in elastic state was proposed, indicating that the stud diameter and the elastic modulus of steel and concrete are the main factors. And the shear stiffness predicted by the new formula agree well with test results for studs with a diameter ranging from 10 to 30 mm in the concrete with compressive strength ranging from 22.0 to 200.0MPa. Then, the effects of shear stiffness on the elastic behaviors of composite girders with different sizes and under different loading conditions were analyzed, the equations for calculating the stress and deformation of simply supported composite girders considering the influence of connection’s shear stiffness were derived under different loading conditions using classical linear partial-interaction theory. As the increasing of shear stiffness, the stress and deflection at the most unfavorable section under partial connected condition tend to be those under full connected condition, but the approaching speed decreases gradually. Finally, the connector’s shear stiffness was recommended for fully connection in composite girders with different dimensions under different loading conditions. The findings from present study may provide a reference for the prediction of shear stiffness for headed studs and the elastic design of steel-concrete composite girder.

The feasibility of the FEA model is verified by a set of test results, consisting of the failure modes, the exposed view of connections, the crack distributions and development, and the hysteretic relationships. The full-range analysis is conducted to investigate the stress and strain development process in the composite joint by using this FEA model. The internal force distributions of different components, as well as the deformation distributions, are analyzed under different failure modes. The proposed connections are investigated under dimensional and material parameters, and the proper constructional details of the connections are recommended. Parameters of the beam-column joints, including material strength, confinement factor, reinforcement ratio, diameter of steel tube to sectional width ratio, beam to column linear bending stiffness ratio and beam shear span ratio are evaluated. Furthermore, the key parameters affecting the failure modes and the corresponding parameters ranges are proposed in this paper.

The study takes into account the time and position of behavior change during the process of concrete dam service. There is no dependence on the effect quantity for overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional identification method. The panel data model is firstly proposed for analyzing the behavior change of composite concrete dam. The change-point theory is used to identify whether the behavior of concrete dams changes during service. The phase space reconstruction technique is used to reconstruct the phase plane of the trend effect component. The time dimension method is used to solve the construction of multi-transformation model of composite panel data. An existing 76.3-m-high dam is used to investigate some key issues on the behavior change. Emphasis is placed on conversion time and location for three time periods consistent with the practical analysis report for evaluating the validity of the analysis method of the behavior variation of concrete dams presented in this paper.

They come from the concept of composite slabs. Conventional connectors such as shear studs and binding bars were used in previous studies to act as the internal mechanical connectors to lock the external steel faceplates to the concrete core. However, the restraint effects of these connectors were sometimes not strong enough. In this research, a recently proposed unique type of steel truss was employed along the wall height to enhance the composite action between the two materials. Concrete-filled tube columns were used as the boundary elements. Due to the existence of boundary columns, the restraints of steel faceplates to the concrete differ significantly for the walls with different widths. Therefore, there is a need to explore the effect of height-to-width ratio on the structural behavior of the wall. In the test program, three specimens were designed with the height of 3000 mm, the thickness of 150 mm, and different widths, to simulate the real walls in practice. Axial compression was applied by two actuators on the tested walls. The axial behavior of the walls was evaluated based on the analysis of test results. The influences of height-to-width ratio on structural performance were evaluated. Finally, discussion was made on code-based design.

As n-type dopants, sulfur atoms are generallyused to change the electron concentration of InP-based devices, whereas the effects of sulfur doping on SFs of InP havenot been studied in detail. In this work, the generalized stacking fault (GSF) energies of pure and sulfur-doped InP have beeninvestigated by gliding the layers successively in the framework of first principle calculations. The results reveal the stableSF energies of InP are low and extrinsic stacking fault could be seen as the twin embryos in pure InP. Sulfur doping coulddecrease the GSF energies dramatically due to the lower charge density along In-S bonds than along In-P bonds, which consequentlyenhances the ability of twinning locally. The preferential segregation of sulfur atoms on SFs or twin boundariescould further promote the thickening of microtwin in InP. These results are of great significance to the understanding of theformation of planar defects in n-type doped III?V compounds.

Furthermore, it has been shown that these charged nanoparticles can contribute to the growth of thin films,nanowires, nanotetrapods and so on. Here, the generation of charged silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles in the gas phaseduring a hot wire CVD process was studied by capturing nanoparticles with a different delay time on a silicon monoxidemembrane of the copper mesh grid for transmission electron microscope. The average size of SiC nanoparticles capturedfor 30 s increased from 2.9 to 6.1 nm with increasing delay time from 0 to 60 min. The deposition behavior of SiC filmswas affected by the applied bias on a substrate holder. A homo-epitaxial SiC film as thick as ~ 200 nm was grown under thesubstrate bias of ? 200 V, whereas polycrystalline SiC films were grown under 0 V and + 15 V. It indicates that nanoparticlesgenerated in the gas phase should be charged.

In this paper, a load-slip curve prediction method of the shear connection based on the artificial neural networks (ANNs) is proposed. The factors which are significantly related to the structural and deformation performance of the connection are selected, and the shear stiffness of shear connections and the transverse coordinate slip value of the load-slip curve are taken as the input parameters of the network. Load values corresponding to the slip values are used as the output parameter. A two-layer hidden layer network with 15 nodes and 10 nodes is designed. The test data of two different forms of shear connections, the stud shear connection and the perforated shear connection with flange heads, are collected from the previous literatures, and the data of six specimens are selected as the two prediction data sets, while the data of other specimens are used to train the neural networks. Two trained networks are used to predict the load-slip curves of their corresponding prediction data sets, and the ratio method is used to study the proximity between the prediction loads and the test loads. Results show that the load-slip curves predicted by the networks agree well with the test curves.

To commercialize stretchable devices, it is necessary to optimize the deformation ofstretchable electrodes based on a given device elongation range. Therefore, we investigated the deformation mechanics ofa silver nanowire (AgNW) electrode on an elastomeric substrate depending on its junction treatment method. At low-strain(< 15%), a thermally annealed AgNW electrode showed more stable resistance than a laser-welded AgNW electrode. Conversely,at high strain (> 20%), the thermally annealed AgNW electrode rapidly increased in resistance, while the laser-weldedAgNW electrode showed lower resistivity change. By in situ surface analysis and a repetitive tensile test, we observed thatthe thermally annealed AgNW electrode shows less cracking at low strain but the laser-welded AgNW electrode exhibitsfracturing of individual nanowires at low strain. Furthermore, at high strain, laser-welded AgNWs could slide to reducestress during elongation, resulting in a smaller change in resistance compared to that of thermally annealed AgNW electrode.
These results indicate that optimization of adhesion is necessary to fabricate stretchable devices based on deformation range."
